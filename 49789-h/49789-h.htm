ELECTION.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech at a Public Meeting at Faneuil Hall, Boston,
November 8, 1864.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>At an impromptu meeting for congratulation, on the evening of the
Presidential election, as the votes were announced, there were speeches
by Mr. Hooper, Mr. Sumner, Dr. Loring, Mr. Rice, and Mr. Everett.
Mr. Sumner spoke as follows.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">FELLOW-CITIZENS,&mdash;The trumpet of victory is
now sounding through the land, “Glory, Hallelujah!”
[<i>Loud cheers.</i>] It is the silver trumpet of an
archangel, echoing in valleys, traversing mountains, and
filling the whole country with immortal melodies, destined
to awaken other echoes in the most distant places
[<i>cheers</i>], as it proclaims “Liberty throughout all the land,
unto all the inhabitants thereof.” [<i>Great applause.</i>]</p>

<p>Such is the victory we celebrate, marking an epoch
in our history and in the history of the world. But
beyond immediate victory are two things not usually
occurring together,&mdash;a funeral and a birth. [<i>Great
laughter and applause.</i>] The funeral we celebrate is
of the Democratic party, which we bury to-night with
all the dishonors that belong to it. Loathsome with
corruption while still above ground, let it be hurried
out of sight, where it will no longer be a nuisance.
[<i>Tremendous cheering.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>The Democratic party had ceased to be patriotic. It
was in sympathy with the Rebellion, so much so as
to be its <i>Northern wing</i>. Such a party could not exist
in a country that had determined to exist. It was an
outrage and a shame, and hereafter it can never be
mentioned except with judgment. [<i>Cries of “That’s
so!” and cheers.</i>]</p>

<p>The extent of its degradation is seen in the frauds
it has perpetrated to influence this election. Nothing
so mean as these. Fraud is always odious; but it becomes
more so in proportion to the occasion on which
it is employed. It is odious in small things,&mdash;doubly
odious in greater things. To cheat one man is crime;
to cheat a whole class of men is greater far. But if
these men be citizen soldiers fighting for their country,
and it is proposed to cheat them of their votes by barefaced
fraud, I know no language to depict the despicable
and most intolerable enormity of the offence. And
yet this is the fraud attempted,&mdash;happily the last and
dying fraud of the Democratic party. [<i>Applause.</i>] Do
you inquire the origin of this fraud, and its vicious
energy? I answer, It is Slavery. Men who make up
their minds to sustain Slavery stick at nothing. If
willing to forge chains, they will not hesitate to forge
votes. If ready to enslave their fellow-men, they will
not hesitate to cheat soldiers. Therefore all these recent
frauds are derived naturally out of that baseness
and insensibility to right bred of Slavery. [<i>Applause.</i>]
But these frauds testify against the Democratic party,
that undertook to perpetrate them.</p>

<p>There was an English monarch, whose head, as it
dropped from the block, was held up to the people, while
a voice cried, “This is the head of a traitor!” Thus do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
I hold up the head of the Democratic party, and say,
“This is the head of a traitor!” Let it be buried out of
sight, and let the people dance at its funeral. [<i>Tremendous
applause.</i>]</p>

<p>I have said that we celebrate a birth, as well as a
funeral. The birth is the new life of our country,
born to-day into assured freedom, with all its attendant
glory. The voice of the people at the ballot-box has
echoed back that great letter of the President, “To
whom it may concern” [<i>laughter and loud cheers</i>], declaring
the integrity of the Union and the abandonment
of Slavery the two essential conditions of peace. [<i>Loud
applause.</i>] Let the glad tidings go forth, “to whom it
may concern,”&mdash;to all the people of the United States,
at length now made wholly free,&mdash;to foreign countries,&mdash;to
the whole family of man,&mdash;to posterity,&mdash;to the
martyred band who have fallen in battle for their country,&mdash;to
the angels above,&mdash;ay, and to the devils below,&mdash;that
this Republic shall live, for Slavery is dead.
This is the great joy we now announce to the world.
[<i>Here there was a perfect torrent of approving cheers.</i>]</p>

<p>From this time forward, the Rebellion is subdued.
Patriot Unionists in the Rebel States, take courage!
Freedmen, slaves no longer, be of good cheer! The
hour of deliverance has arrived. [<i>Renewed cheering.</i>]</p>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Letter to the Young Men’s Republican Union of New York,
November 10, 1864.</span></p>

<div class="medium">

<p>A public meeting, called a Jubilee, was held at the Cooper Institute,
New York, to celebrate the recent victory at the polls. Among
the letters read was the following.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Boston</span>, November 10, 1864.</p>

<p class="dropcap">DEAR SIR,&mdash;It will not be in my power to meet
with the Union citizens of New York at the “Jubilee”
of Friday evening, according to the invitation
with which you honor me. But my joy will mingle
with theirs.</p>

<p>The occasion you celebrate is worthy of jubilee, which
in the Hebrew language is simply “the blast of a trumpet,”
and now, in all languages, signifies “rejoicing.”</p>

<p>The occasion is kindred to that famous jubilee in sacred
history, when the mandate went forth, “<i>Proclaim
Liberty throughout all the land</i>, unto all the inhabitants
thereof: it shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return
every man unto his possession, and ye shall return
every man unto his family.” And now this same mandate
has gone forth, assuring the return of patriot Unionists
to their possessions, and the return of patriot
soldiers to their families, and crowning all with Universal
Emancipation, sign and seal of union and peace.
Such is the mandate of the American people in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
reëlection of Abraham Lincoln. I pray that it may all
be executed promptly and triumphantly.</p>

<p>Thank God, the pettifoggers of compromise are answered
by the people, who demand peace on the everlasting

<p class="dropcap">DEAR SIR,&mdash;It will not be in my power to unite
in the banquet to your most faithful Representative.</p>

<p>I know Mr. Ashley well, and honor him much. He
has been firm when others have hesitated, and from an
early day saw the secret of this war, and, I may add, the
secret of victory also. In all questions of statesmanship,
which will soon supersede military questions, he has
already given assurance of practical wisdom. His various
indefatigable labors and his elaborate speech on
“Reconstruction” show that he sees well what is to be
done in order to place peace and liberty under impregnable
safeguards.</p>

<p>For myself, I have no hesitation in saying, that, next
to the Rebellion itself, I most deprecate a premature
State Government in a Rebel State. Such a Government
will be a source of sorrow and weakness incalculable.
But I am sure that your Representative will
fail in no effort to prevent such a calamity.</p>

<p>There is also the Amendment of the Constitution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
prohibiting Slavery throughout the United States. Nobody
has done more for it, practically, than Mr. Ashley.</p>

<p>Accept my thanks for the invitation with which you
have honored me, and believe me, dear Sir,</p>

<h2><a name="CASE_OF_THE_FLORIDA" id="CASE_OF_THE_FLORIDA"></a>CASE OF THE FLORIDA:<br />
ILLUSTRATED BY PRECEDENTS OF BRITISH SEIZURES
IN NEUTRAL WATERS.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Articles in the Boston Daily Advertiser, November 29, 1864,
and January 17, 1865.</span></p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The case of the Florida attracted attention at the time, and aroused
the British press. Especially to meet the criticism of the latter the
first of the following articles was written. Though published in a newspaper
anonymously, its authorship was recognized and acknowledged,
and it was reprinted in a pamphlet by the Young Men’s Republican
Union of New York.</p>

<p>The Florida was a Rebel war-steamer, built in England, which had
done damage to our commerce. After capturing and burning the bark
Mondamon off Pernambuco, it arrived at Bahia Bay, October 5, 1864,
where the United States steamer Wachusett, with Captain Napoleon
Collins as commander, was then lying. The Florida at first anchored
in the offing, but, at the invitation of the Brazilian admiral, came inside
in the midst of the Brazilian fleet, and close under the guns of the
principal fort. At about three o’clock on the morning of October 7th, the
Wachusett slipped her cables, and, with full head of steam, bore down
upon the Rebel war-vessel, one half of whose officers and crew, including
Captain Morris, were on shore, and the remainder, having just returned,
were in no condition to repel an assault. The officer of the
deck, supposing the collision which he saw imminent merely accidental,
cried out, “You will run into us, if you don’t look out.” The design
of Captain Collins was to strike the Florida amidships, crush in her
side, and send her at once to the bottom; but this was not accomplished;
the Wachusett struck only the stern, carrying away the mizzen-mast
and main-yard, so that the Rebel vessel was not seriously injured,
but the broken spars fell across the awning over the hatchway, and
thus prevented her crew from getting on deck. In the confusion that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
ensued several pistol-shots were fired from both vessels, at random and
without effect. Two of the Wachusett’s guns were discharged,&mdash;by
accident, according to one report, or, as another had it, by order of a
lieutenant. The shots did not strike the Florida. Captain Collins
cried out immediately, “Surrender, or I will blow you out of the water!”
The lieutenant in charge of the Florida replied, “Under the
circumstances I surrender.” In an instant the vessel was boarded by
men from the Wachusett, who made her fast by a hawser to their own
vessel, which at once turned her course seaward, moving at the top of
her speed and towing the Florida in her wake.</p>

<p>The Wachusett was challenged from the Brazilian fleet, but there
was no reply. The Florida, when commanded to stop, answered that
she was towed by the vessel in front. Shortly afterward the heavy
guns of the fort opened fire. Three shots passed harmlessly above the
pennant of the Wachusett, striking the water beyond. Two vessels of
the Brazilian fleet gave chase, but soon abandoned it, and the Florida
was brought to Hampton Roads, where it was anchored.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the case passed into diplomacy. Mr. Seward addressed
a note, under date of November 11th, to Mr. Webb, the minister of the
United States at Rio Janeiro, directing him to say that the Government
of the United States was not indisposed to examine the subject upon
its merits carefully, and to consider whatever questions might arise out
of it in a becoming and friendly spirit, if that spirit was adopted by
his Imperial Majesty’s Government. The Brazilian representative at
Washington, in a note dated December 12th, expressed the belief that
the Government of the United States would give the explanations and
reparation which, in conformity with international laws, are due to
a power that maintains friendly and pacific relations with it. Mr.
Seward, in his reply, dated December 26th, disallowed the assumption
that the Rebels were “a lawful naval belligerent,” and asserted, that,
being still “destitute of naval forces, ports, and courts,” the ascription
of that character to them by Brazil “is an act of intervention in
derogation of the Law of Nations, and unfriendly and wrongful, as it is
manifestly injurious, to the United States.” He also disallowed the assumption
that the Florida belonged to the Rebels, and maintained, “on
the contrary, that that vessel, like the Alabama, was a pirate, belonging
to no nation or lawful belligerent.” He added, that it did not belong
to captains of ships-of-war of the United States, acting without
authority, to assert the rights and redress the wrongs of the country.
The captured crew, being unlawfully brought into the national custody,
could not be lawfully subjected here to the punishment they deserved,
and were therefore set at liberty. Then follows this statement with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
regard to the vessel: “The Florida was brought into American waters,
and was anchored under naval surveillance and protection at Hampton
Roads. While awaiting the representation of the Brazilian Government,
on the 28th of November, she sunk, owing to a leak which could not
be seasonably stopped. The leak was at first represented to have been
caused, or at least increased, by a collision with a war transport.” After
stating that there were courts of inquiry on the subject, he concluded:
“In the mean time it is assumed that the loss of the Florida was a
consequence of some unforeseen accident, which cast no responsibility
upon the United States.”<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Nothing further occurred in this case.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>Advertiser</i>, in a leader on this article, after alluding to the author
as “a gentleman whose position and pursuits have led him to give great
attention to questions of International Law,” says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We ask attention to his view of the precedents, therefore, and to the
connection which he establishes between them and the present case, as being
both interesting and instructive, and as deserving no small weight in settling
our views upon this important subject. He makes it clear, that, whatever
Brazil may feel herself called upon to say in the matter, it does not lie in the
mouth of England, either by her press or her ministry, to intermeddle by
lecturing the United States.… The most embarrassing feature in the
Florida case, however, has been removed within a few hours by the fortuitous
collision of an army transport with this steamer, in the crowded
roadstead at Fortress Monroe.”</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">If we may judge from recent English newspapers,
there is to be another cry against us, on account of
the Florida, not unlike that on account of the Trent.
One paper says the seizure was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> “most flagrantly lawless”;
another, that “the precedent will establish a
claim to the right to pursue and destroy every such
vessel, whatever may be the port in which she may
seek shelter or supplies”; another, that “the outrage
cannot be permitted to pass unnoticed by other powers”;
and still another, that “events such as these will
speedily force European nations to interfere in the
American difficulty for their own security.” Such are
specimens of British criticism, before the facts in the
case have been ascertained in any authentic form, and
before our Government has had opportunity to declare
itself on the subject.</p>

<p>The same swiftness occurred in the matter of the
Trent. The parallel will be complete, if Earl Russell
sends us a letter of complaint.</p>

<p>As in that remarkable instance, there is the same indifference
to <i>historic precedents</i>. I do not refer to cases
decided in prize courts, where the question is of <i>strict
law</i>, which must prevail,&mdash;as where Sir William Scott
decreed restitution of a vessel captured by a British privateer
stationed among the mud islands at the mouth
of the Mississippi, and within the neutral territory of
the United States. I refer to another class of precedents,
not to be found in judicial decisions, but in the
history of Great Britain. And as, in the instance of
the Trent, it appeared that this power had for several
generations, under a pretended claim, entered on
board foreign ships and forcibly dragged away persons
from the protection of their flag, thus doing on a
large scale what was done by Commodore Wilkes on a
very small scale,&mdash;so it appears that this same power,
whose newspapers are now swift to condemn the act
of Captain Collins, has for many generations been in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
the habit of seizing or destroying vessels in neutral
waters.</p>

<p><i>Judicial decisions</i> exhibit the strict law obligatory on
courts. <i>Historic precedents</i> exhibit the practice of nations,
where strict law is often modified by considerations
of necessity or policy. The first, as a general rule,
concern private rights; the second, as a general rule,
concern public rights. The first are questions for the
court; the second are questions for executive deliberation
and for diplomacy. It is needless to add that the
case of the Florida is not a case of private rights. It is
an historic incident, destined hereafter to be a precedent,
which will be determined by the executive, and
not by the judiciary. If the Florida were an ordinary
private ship, claimed by private individuals, it would
naturally fall under the cognizance of a prize court.
But it is claimed as a public ship, which, as is well
known, is not subject to the jurisdiction of a prize
court. Or, assuming its private character by reason of
its piratical origin, there are questions involved which
must ultimately come under the cognizance of the
Executive, and which belong to the history of the
country.</p>

<p>Of course, the general principle of International Law
applicable to such an incident is beyond question. It
is found in the authoritative words of the Dutch publicist,
Bynkershoek, when he says, “Certainly it is by
no means lawful to attack or take an enemy in the
port of a neutral who is in amity with both parties.”<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Chancellor Kent, a great authority, enforces the same
principle, when he says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> “It is not lawful to make
neutral territory the scene of hostility, or to attack an
enemy while within it.”<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> General Halleck, in his excellent
work on International Law, says: “Hostilities
cannot be lawfully exercised within the territorial jurisdiction
of the neutral state which is the common friend
of both parties.” And he follows this compendious
statement with the remark, that “the Government of
the United States has invariably claimed the absolute
inviolability of neutral territory.”<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> As early as 1793,
our Government gave its adhesion to this principle in a
case where Great Britain and France were the hostile
parties. The British merchant-ship Grange was captured
in Delaware Bay by a French frigate, and brought
into Philadelphia, to which port she was bound. Mr.
Jefferson, in a gossiping letter to Mr. Monroe, under
date of May 5, 1793, says: “Upon her coming into
sight, thousands and thousands of the yeomanry of the
city crowded and covered the wharves. Never before
was such a crowd seen there; and when the British
colors were seen reversed, and the French flying above
them, they burst into peals of exultation.”<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The British
minister, addressing himself at once to our Government,
demanded restitution of the captured vessel,
then within our jurisdiction. The French minister insisted
that Delaware Bay was an open sea, so that the
original capture was lawful. <i>But the ship was restored.</i>
Washington was at the time President, and Jefferson
Secretary of State. It is not known that there was any
appearance in the prize court with reference to the
Grange. It was settled by diplomacy, as will be seen
by a formal letter of the Secretary of State addressed to
the French minister, where he says:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> “I am charged by
the President of the United States to express to you his
expectation, and at the same time his confidence, that
you will be pleased to take immediate and effectual
measures for having the ship Grange and her cargo
restored to the British owners, and the persons taken
on board her set at liberty.”<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The general principle
illustrated by this striking case has been maintained
by our Government ever since. If any reader is curious
to see an elaborate vindication of it, I refer him
to a very animated article in the “Boston Gazette”
for 1814, transferred to “Niles’s Register,”<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> where the
inviolability of neutral territory is upheld, especially
against the open pretensions of Great Britain.</p>

<p>This general principle may seem at first view conclusive
with regard to the Florida. If this vessel, now
lying within the jurisdiction of the United States, were
an ordinary private ship, cognizable in a prize court,
or if it were still within the jurisdiction of Brazil, it
might be so. But it remains to be seen whether there
are not decisive considerations, <i>distinguishing this case
from every other</i>, which will justify our Government,
while recognizing the violation of Brazilian territory,
and making all proper apologies, <i>at least in declining
any restitution of the ship</i>. On this point it is not
necessary to express an opinion. I began by allusion
to the reckless judgments of British journals, tending
to excite a cry against our country; and my present
object will be accomplished, if I exhibit those <i>historic
precedents</i> which must close the British mouth, whenever
it opens to condemn a capture like that of the
Florida.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>1. It was in the reign of Queen Elizabeth that England
began to contest the supremacy of the seas; and
it was in this same reign that this domineering power
began those pretensions under which neutral rights of
all kinds were set at nought. As early as 1567, Hawkins,
fresh from a slave-trading voyage in the ship
“Jesus,” fired at a Spanish ship in the harbor of Plymouth,
and forced her to lower her flag. The Spanish
ambassador said indignantly to Elizabeth: “Your mariners
rob my master’s subjects on the sea; they plunder
our people in the streets of your towns; <i>they attack our
vessels in your very harbors</i>. I entreat your Majesty to
punish this last outrage at Plymouth, and to preserve
the peace between the two nations.”<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Elizabeth gave
a smooth answer, and that was all.</p>

<p>2. Not long afterwards Admiral Drake entered the
harbor of Cadiz, where he scattered, sunk, and burned
an immense fleet of Spanish transports, and then did
the same thing in the harbor of Lisbon. There were
apologies on the part of Elizabeth; Burleigh wrote
a crafty letter; the Admiral was disavowed; but this
was all.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Among the ships seized at Lisbon were no
less than sixty belonging to the Hanse Towns. <i>These
towns vainly demanded their restitution.</i> Philip of
Spain, at that time sovereign of Portugal, was equally
unsuccessful, although, by way of retaliation, he drove
from Lisbon the factors of the Company of English
Merchants.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Such are some of the earliest historic precedents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>3. In similar defiance of unquestionable right, the
Dutch East India fleet, in 1665, which had put into
Bergen in Norway, was attacked by the English in
this neutral port. On this outrage Vattel remarks:
“But the Governor of Bergen fired on the assailants,
and the Court of Denmark complained, perhaps too
faintly, of an enterprise so injurious to its dignity and
its rights.”<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>4. Throughout the seventeenth century numerous
incidents illustrate the pretensions of Great Britain;
and so also in the next century. Émérigon, the famous
French authority on the Law of Insurance, mentions
one which deserves notice. In 1757, a French bark, La
Victoire, chased by a British privateer, sought refuge
in the neutral waters of Majorca, where she anchored
within pistol-shot of the shore. The British privateer
seized the bark, notwithstanding three shots fired from
the castle. A few days later the prize was recaptured
by a French privateer. The original owners of
the bark claimed her, on the ground that her capture
was null; but the court of prizes awarded one third
to the recaptor.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The learned author fails to record
any reparation by Great Britain.</p>

<p>Advancing to later times, the historic precedents multiply.
I pass over a considerable period, not without
examples, and come at once to those occurring in the
protracted war against the French Revolution.</p>

<p>5. War had hardly begun, when, in 1793, the port
of Genoa was the scene of an incident differing from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
that in Bahia only in its very aggravating circumstances,
and in the bloodshed that ensued. The French
frigate La Modeste was quietly at anchor in this neutral
harbor when a British ship-of-the-line came alongside.
Suddenly the British commander summoned the
Frenchman to surrender. On his refusal, the frigate
was boarded, and three hundred of the unarmed crew
were massacred. The frigate was carried to England.
Such is the account given by a French author, who
complains bitterly that the British Government did
nothing to punish the outrage. The Genoese Government
was powerless; and the French Convention, in
a decree marked by great moderation, proceeded to
release it from all responsibility, although at a later
day it appears to have paid two millions of francs as
an indemnity.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The reader curious in dates will not
fail to observe that it was in the very year when the
neutrality of Genoa was thus set at defiance that the
British minister in the United States claimed the surrender
of a ship seized by a French frigate in defiance
of our neutrality. Such are famous contradictions of
national conduct. A British ship captured by France
in neutral waters was surrendered at the demand of
Great Britain; a French ship captured by Great Britain
in neutral waters was hurried off by the captor as prize
of war.</p>

<p>6. The same author who has described the outrage
in the harbor of Genoa adds that Admiral Nelson afterwards
carried off another French vessel in full view of
the Genoese batteries.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>7. Another instance appears, where Admiral Nelson,
in 1798, entered the neutral port of Leghorn, and seized
a fleet of Genoese ships with rich cargoes. The author
who records this outrage makes it “yet otherwise culpable
on account of the high position of the personage,
who, without respect for the independence and dignity
of a friendly and neutral nation, assumed the moral
responsibility of it.”<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>8. The same lawlessness governing British commanders
in Leghorn and Genoa appeared also this side of the
Atlantic. In August, 1795, an audacious attempt was
made by the British ship-of-war Africa to seize the
French minister, M. Fauchet, when on his way from
New York to Newport, on board the sloop Peggy, within
the waters of the United States. The sloop was
boarded at the entrance of Newport harbor, and within
two miles of the light-house, and the trunks of the minister
were overhauled; but he had already left at an intermediate
port, so that the trespassers were disappointed.
M. Fauchet, in a communication to his successor, M.
Adet, says: “I shall express to you but one afflicting
sentiment, which is, that in a free State, with a government
in which England has just acquired a friend, there
is no safety for myself or my papers; for, in a word, as
it was from <i>a public packet-boat in a neutral port</i> that I
was to have been carried off, there is no reason why I
should not be taken on the highway or in an inn, if it
could be done with impunity.” Our Government vainly
endeavored to obtain reparation from Great Britain for
this outrage, while France, on her part, mentioned the
“impunity” of its authors among her causes of complaint
against us. It is only recently that the facts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
of this remarkable case have appeared in a document
printed by order of the Senate.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> They help swell the
present testimony.</p>

<p>9. Taking these instances in the order of time, we
come next to outrages on the coast of Norway. The
British frigate Squirrel, on entering the Norwegian
port of Oster-Risoer, in 1801, then belonging to Denmark,
seized a Swedish ship, and put its pilot in irons.
Then coming to anchor, it deliberately captured three
other Swedish vessels, and, sending on shore, kidnapped
several pilots. Two or three days afterwards, a boat
from another British man-of-war, the cutter Achilles,
entered the Norwegian port of Egvang, and seized a
French prize at anchor there, while the cutter’s crew
fired upon a bark having on board peaceable inhabitants,
wounding one of them. The Danish Government
promptly demanded reparation for these accumulated
outrages, and especially the restitution of the vessels.
The British minister, Lord Hawkesbury, at once declared
that the guilty individuals should receive the
strongest marks of disapprobation from his Government,
<i>but that, with regard to the restitution of the
vessels, it was impossible for him, in the existing circumstances
of the two countries, to enter into any explanation</i>,&mdash;that,
if the present misunderstanding should
be amicably adjusted, “these cases would naturally be
carried, without loss of time, <i>before the regular and
impartial tribunals</i> established for the decision of such
causes, according to principles of justice and the Law
of Nations.” The Danish minister at once replied,
that his sovereign would never consent that the open
violation of his ports and his territory should become,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
under any pretext, the subject of deliberation and decision
in any tribunals whatever,&mdash;that his sovereign
and territorial rights were assured, and he would not
abandon them. Lord Hawkesbury was moved, in reply,
to disapprove the conduct of the British officers, <i>and
to order the restitution of the Swedish vessels captured in
the port of Oster-Risoer</i>. At the very moment of this
“incomplete reparation,” as it has been called, Great
Britain was preparing her first expedition against Copenhagen.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>10. The same French author, who, in ardor for neutral
rights, has exposed the conduct of Great Britain,
mentions the instance of an English frigate, in 1803,
which, after capturing a Swedish vessel in a Norwegian
port, entered the neutral port of Bergen, where
her commander attempted to seize a Dutch vessel and
two French privateers. These three vessels were saved
by crawling, with permission of the Governor, under
the guns of the fortress; but the attempt was a violation
of the neutral waters of Bergen, which passed
without reparation.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>11. M. de Cussy also mentions, that, during this
same year, a British man-of-war insulted a French vessel
in the neutral port of Lisbon.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>12. The next instance was again on this side of the
Atlantic, and in the neutral waters of our own coast.
The French ship-of-the-line L’Impétueux, separated in
a storm from the fleet to which she belonged, and much
disabled, was discovered, September, 1806, by several
British men-of-war off Cape Henry. The French ship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
turned her head to the land, and was actually aground
before the British ships came within cannon-shot. But,
though in this disabled condition, and on the very
shores of the United States, she received a British
broadside. The French commander vainly protested
that he was on neutral territory. His crew were taken
prisoners, and his ship was burned. This act was a violation
of the Law of Nations doubly noticeable, as the
immunity of our coast “within cannon-shot” had been
expressly recognized in the Treaty of 1794 between
Great Britain and the United States. As the ship was
burned, there could be no question of its restitution.
But it does not appear that there was reparation of
any kind,&mdash;not even apology.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>13. The outrage upon the frigate Chesapeake properly
belongs to this list, for it was a barefaced and most
insulting violation of territorial jurisdiction. This was
in June, 1807, while the United States were at peace
with all the world. The Chesapeake, having proceeded
to sea, was followed by the British frigate Leopard,
lying at Hampton Roads, which, after ranging alongside,
commenced a heavy fire, until the commander
of the Chesapeake felt it his duty to strike his colors
and to inform the British commander that the Chesapeake
was his prize. It is needless to mention the
details of this unparalleled enormity, or the mingled
anger and humiliation which ensued in the country, as
they became known. A demand for reparation was
made at once; but it was only after four years of negotiation
that the terms of adjustment were mutually
accepted. There was no ship to restore; but the men
forcibly taken from the Chesapeake were,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> “as far as
circumstances would admit,” returned to that frigate, then
lying in the harbor of Boston.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>14. At the time these outrages were perpetrated on
our coast, another, on a larger scale, was planned and
executed in the Baltic. Denmark had been “scrupulously
neutral”; but the British Government feared
that its fleet at Copenhagen might in some way be
appropriated by Napoleon, whose Continental supremacy
had recently culminated at the Peace of Tilsit.
It was determined to seize this fleet, and a naval
expedition of corresponding force was directed against
Copenhagen. The Danes made a brave resistance; but
at last, on the 7th of September, 1807, they were compelled
to capitulate. The Danish fleet was surrendered
to the British admiral.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>15. Then came the American frigate Essex, under
Captain Porter, captured by a superior British force
in the neutral waters of Valparaiso. The Essex had
made a very successful cruise, and become a terror to
British navigation. It was important to stop her victories.
The newspapers of the time assert that “an Admiralty
order was issued, commanding the officers of
British ships in the South Seas <i>not to respect any port
as neutral where the Essex should be found</i>.” It is certain
that the British commander acted in this spirit.
With two frigates, the Phœbe and the Cherub, March
28, 1814, he opened fire upon the Essex, then at anchor,
according to her log-book, “in nine and an half
fathoms water, within half-pistol shot of the shore.”
After a desperate battle of two hours and a half,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Captain Porter was compelled to surrender. The people
glowed with admiration of his gallantry, and indignation
at what was called “this glaring defiance of
the clearest principle of National Law.” It was said,
that, “though the country had lost a ship, it had lost
nothing else.”<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> But here the matter ended. The ship
was never restored; nor does it appear to have been
the subject of reclamation, either by our Government
upon Spain, or by Spain upon Great Britain. The President’s
message at the opening of the next Congress,
while commending the gallantry of Captain Porter,
does not even allude to the violation of International
Law in his capture. But it will be remarked, that at
this time the South American colonies were beginning
to be convulsed by that long revolutionary war which
closed with their independence, so that there was a
practical difficulty in obtaining any remedy for this
outrage. We could not apply directly to England, and
neither Spain nor Chile was in condition to receive any
such application. Silence on our part was the only policy.
But the act is not forgotten among the precedents
of British history.</p>

<p>16. Then came the General Armstrong, an American
privateer, destroyed by a British squadron in the
neutral waters of Fayal, in September, 1814. There is
a dispute as to certain facts in this case. On the British
side it is said that the privateer fired first and killed
several men. But it is clear that the privateer was
pursued and attacked under the very guns of the Portuguese
fortress, and, after being abandoned by her
crew, was burned by the British. As war at that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
time existed between Great Britain and the United
States, our Government was compelled to resort for
reparation to Portugal, whose neutral territory had been
violated. After a protracted negotiation for more than
a generation, the question was submitted to the arbitration
of Louis Napoleon, while President of the French
Republic, who decided that nothing was due from Portugal.
This was on the ground of exceptional circumstances,
and among other things, that the American
commander “had not applied from the beginning for
the intervention of the neutral sovereign, and that, by
having recourse to arms to repel an unjust aggression
of which he pretended to be the object, he had
himself failed to respect the neutrality of the territory
of the foreign sovereign, and had thereby released
that sovereign from the obligation in which he was
to afford him protection by any other means than
that of a pacific intervention.”<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> In this case the ship
was destroyed, so that there was no question of restitution.
But Great Britain made no reparation of any
kind.</p>

<p>Such are some of the seizures actually made by Great
Britain, in defiance of neutral rights, during the wars
against the French Revolution and against us.</p>

<p>17. There is another incident, belonging to the latter
period, which, though not a consummated seizure,
is in the nature of testimony, especially as it concerns
the very port of Bahia where the Florida was taken.
Commodore Bainbridge, of the Navy of the United
States, after capture of the British frigate Java, left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Captain Lawrence in the Hornet to cruise off the port
of Bahia, instructing him as follows: “You will cruise
off here as long as in your judgment you may deem
it necessary.… Be on your guard against the arrival
of the Montague, seventy-four; <i>and I advise you not
to rely too much on the protection of the neutral port
of Bahia against the [British] Admiral’s influence to
capture you even in port</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Captain Lawrence followed
these instructions, and, though driven by the
Montague into the port, at once took advantage of
the night and escaped to sea, thus eluding British violence
in neutral waters. The Hornet was not “gobbled
up,” as her capture of the Peacock shortly afterwards
amply attests; but it is evident that the will was not
wanting.</p>

<p>18. The long interval of peace after the outrages
last mentioned caused a lull in British pretensions,&mdash;to
be awakened by the blast of war. In 1837, Canada
was disturbed by a rebellion, soon followed by the invasion
of our territorial jurisdiction at Niagara. I refer to
the case of the steamboat Caroline, which, while moored
to the American shore, was entered in the darkness
of night by a British expedition from Canada, set on
fire, and pushed into the rapids to be precipitated over
the cataract. Some persons on board were killed and
others wounded. For this unquestionable violation
of our territory there was no offer of reparation,&mdash;“no
acknowledgment, no explanation, no apology,” as
Mr. Webster expressed it,&mdash;until, nearly five years
afterwards, Lord Ashburton, on his special mission,
expressed regret “that some explanation and apology
was not immediately made.” The amiable language<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
of the British minister was promptly accepted by Mr.
Webster, who was at the time Secretary of State, and
the controversy subsided. The steamboat had been
destroyed; but there was no offer to restore its value,
nor was this question raised by our Government.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>19. The latest instance, in point of time, worth
while to name in this list, is that of the Brazilian
ship Santa Cruz, which, in 1850, was seized and burned,
with all her lading and papers, by a British cruiser in
the Brazilian waters. The excuse for the seizure was
that the ship was engaged in the slave-trade, and for
the burning that she was unseaworthy; but both these
assertions were denied point-blank by the Brazilian
Government, which branded the transaction as “Vandalism,”
and gave notice that it would demand indemnity
for the loss of the ship. As the ship was destroyed,
there was no question of restitution. But
there was formal protest against what was called “a
violation of every principle of the Law of Nations by
acts highly derogatory to the dignity, the sovereignty,
and the independence of Brazil,&mdash;a nation as sovereign
and independent as Great Britain, although it
may not have the power to prevent such proceedings.”<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>20. There is another instance, which, though earlier
in time, I have reserved for the last, on account of the
authentic declarations of an eminent British minister,
bearing on the question now in issue between Brazil
and the United States: I refer to the case of the
French ships burnt or captured at Lagos, in 1759,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
within the territorial jurisdiction of Portugal. A British
fleet under Admiral Boscawen falling in with an
inferior French fleet, the latter took refuge near the
coast. What ensued is thus described in the contemporary
Memoirs of Horace Walpole. “They made a
running fight, but could not escape the vigilance and
bravery of Boscawen. Two of their largest ships were
taken; two others forced on shore and burnt, in one of
which was the commander, who was wounded in both
legs, and expired soon after. The action passed on
the 18th of August.”<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> This incident took its place
among the victories of the year, which, according to
the lively remark of Walpole in another place, were so
numerous as to force him “to ask every morning what
victory there was, for fear of missing one.”<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> But this
victory was followed by an unexpected drawback.
Pombal, a man of genius and courage, and the greatest
administrator Portugal has produced, was at the time
Prime-Minister. He complained vehemently that the
Portuguese territory had been violated, and demanded
satisfaction of Great Britain according to the Law of
Nations.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> In Great Britain, William Pitt, afterwards
Lord Chatham, was at the head of affairs, teaching his
country success in war as in commerce, and filling the
world with English renown. He met this question
promptly. In instructions to the British minister at
Lisbon, written before the Portuguese complaint had
reached him, dated at Whitehall, September 12, 1759,
and marked “Most secret,” he says:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In case you shall find that any violence has actually
been committed by his Majesty’s ships against the immunities
of the coasts of Portugal, it is the King’s pleasure that
you should express in the strongest terms to the Count de
Oeyras [afterwards Marquis of Pombal], and to the other
ministers, the extreme pain which such a most unfortunate
incident must give to the King as soon as the certain knowledge
of it shall reach his Majesty.… At the same time,
in case there has actually been a violation of territory on
our part, you will take care to avail yourself of all the circumstances
of extenuation, of a nature to soften the impressions
which the first sense of any insult on that coast may
have made. But you will be particularly attentive not to
employ any favorable circumstances to justify what the
Law of Nations condemns, but you will insensibly throw
the same into your conversation with insinuations and
address, as considerations of alleviation, which it is to
be hoped may prevent all asperity between two courts so
mutually well disposed to each other, and whose interests
are so inseparable.”</p>

</div>

<p>And the letter closes by declaring that</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“His Majesty has nothing more really at heart than to
give, as far as he can with honor, to the King of Portugal
all reasonable satisfaction that one power in amity can desire
from another upon an incident so totally unforeseen
and without intention of offence.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then follows this postscript:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“P. S. Though it be sufficiently implied by the above
words, <i>all reasonable satisfaction, as far as his Majesty can
with honor</i>, that there are things which his Majesty could
not possibly on any account comply with, I have thought it
may not be improper, for your more certain guidance, expressly
to signify to you that any personal mark on a great
Admiral who has done so essential a service to his country,
or on any one under his command, is totally inadmissible,
<i>as well as the idea of restoring the ships of war taken</i>. You
will therefore, in case, in your conversation with the Portuguese
ministers, any suggestion pointing to either of those
methods of satisfaction should be thrown out, <i>take especial
care to say enough to shut the door entirely against any expectation
of that kind</i>,&mdash;being at the same time particularly attentive
to avoid, in the manner, everything that can carry
the air of peremptoriness or harshness which may interest
the delicacy of the King of Portugal. I am further to
give you to understand, for your private information, that, if
the circumstances of the supposed grievance should come
out to be of sufficient magnitude, such is the King’s strong
desire to give the most public and ostensible satisfaction to
the King of Portugal, that his Majesty will not, I believe,
even be averse to sending an extraordinary mission on this
occasion.”<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The extraordinary embassy promised in this postscript
was despatched to Lisbon; and here we have
another letter of Mr. Pitt, dated at Whitehall, May
30, 1760, and marked “Most secret,” where he declares
anew “the King’s immutable and affectionate concern
for the dignity and independence of the crown of Portugal,”
and enjoins upon his ambassador to “forbear
entering into much controversial reasoning,” and to
“accompany his answer with all possible gentleness
and cordiality of manner, and with the most conciliating
and amicable expressions.” It seems that the Portuguese
minister had demanded the restitution of the
ships, but accompanied by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> “the friendly and confidential
declaration <i>that a compliance therewith was not expected</i>.”
Mr. Pitt was anxious to avoid any such demand,
as “an invidious use would not fail to be made
of it by enemies, and perhaps by neutral powers.”<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
From the Memoirs of Pombal we learn how the British
ambassador acquitted himself.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The King of England sent an ambassador extraordinary
to Lisbon to give the satisfaction which was demanded. It
was Lord Kinnoul who was charged with it, and who acquitted
himself of this commission as the Count de Oeyras
[Marquis of Pombal] required. This lord declared openly
and in full audience, composed of the foreign ministers, that
the English officers who burnt the French vessels on the
coast of Lagos were reprehensible, and that on this account
the King, his master, sent him to Lisbon, in order to testify
that he had no part in it, and that it was contrary to his
orders that they had committed that act of hostility for
which he made reparation.”<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

</div>

<p><i>The ships were not restored</i>, nor was there any indemnity.
But the case did not end here. In 1762 France
declared war against Portugal, and in its declaration
made the failure to obtain restoration of these ships
one of the causes of war. These are the words:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Every one knows the utmost and violent attack made
by the English in 1759 on some of the [French] King’s
ships under the cannon of the Portuguese forts at Lagos.
His Majesty demanded of the Most Faithful King to procure
him restitution of those ships; but that Prince’s ministers,
in contempt of what was due to the rules of justice,
the laws of the sea, the sovereignty and territory of their
master (all which were indecently violated by the most
scandalous infraction of the rights of sovereigns and of nations),
in answer to the repeated requisitions of the King’s
ambassador on this head, made only vague speeches, with
an air of indifference that bordered on derision.”<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus, while Great Britain was saved from the restitution
of the ships, Portugal was compelled to suffer.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such are historic precedents furnished by Great Britain
to illustrate the case of the Florida. In face of this
long array, it is difficult to see how British critics or
British ministers can venture to reproach us.</p>

<p>From this review it appears, that, where ships have
been captured in neutral waters, their restitution was
at least on one occasion positively refused by a British
minister of commanding authority, while on other occasions
it was avoided from destruction of the ships.
If the American commander who undertook this business
at Bahia had done it completely, there would be
little difficulty now. There were fire and water both
at his service. He might have burned the Florida or
scuttled her at once, and his offence would have been
no greater than now, while, according to the precedents,
his Government would have been relieved from embarrassment.</p>

<p>But there are peculiar circumstances which distinguish
this instance from every other. They may be
mentioned under two heads: I shall only allude to
them.</p>

<p><i>First.</i> The Florida was illegitimate and piratical in
origin and conduct, being little more than a lawless
gypsy of the sea,&mdash;born contrary to the Law of Nations,
and living in constant defiance of that law.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Secondly.</i> The Florida pretended to belong to a Rebel
combination of slave-masters, now engaged in rebellion
for the sake of Slavery. Though certain foreign
powers, including Brazil, have conceded to this Rebel
combination what are called “belligerent rights,” yet
the extent of this concession is undecided. Of course,
it is much less than a recognition of national independence.
Every presumption must be against such a
Rebel combination, having such an object. The indecent
haste with which “belligerent rights” were originally
conceded cannot be forgotten now; nor can we
neglect the well-founded argument, that, in the absence
of prize courts belonging to the pretended power, any
such concession <i>on the ocean</i> was flagrantly unjust, and,
when we consider its wide-spread consequences, to be
reprehended always by our Government, as it must be
by impartial history. Assuming that the restitution
of a ship belonging to an independent power, as to
France or England, might be properly required, it does
not follow that such restitution should be required in
a case like the present, where the pretended owner is
not an independent power, and where the ship was
lawless in origin and conduct,&mdash;or, in other words, that
Brazil should expect the United States to restore the
Florida, that it might be handed over again to the
support of a slaveholding Rebellion and to burn more
ships.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I call attention to these considerations without expressing
any final opinion. The case of Koszta, forcibly
taken by an American frigate from an Austrian
ship-of-war in the territorial waters of Turkey, shows
how the conduct of governments is sometimes inconsistent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
with strict law. An explanation and apology
were promptly offered to Turkey, whose neutrality
had been violated; but this was all. There was no
offer on our part to surrender Koszta; nor was there
any demand by Turkey for his restitution. But the
present case is stronger than that of Koszta.</p>

<p>It is well understood that the seizure of the Florida
was wrong only with respect to Brazil, and not with
respect to the Rebel enemy. There can be no demand,
therefore, unless Brazil steps forward. Whatever is
done must be in her name and at her instance. The
enlightened Emperor of Brazil is of the royal house of
Braganza, which reigned in Portugal when her great
minister, Pombal, forbore to press the restitution of
ships captured by the British in Portuguese waters.
Here is a precedent of his own family, completely applicable.
I venture to add that he would do an inconsiderate
and unfriendly act, if he should press the
restitution of a ship obnoxious not only as a public
enemy, but as the piratical agent of a wicked Rebellion.
Even admitting that the capture was null by the Law
of Nations, yet the nature of the reparation to be demanded
rests absolutely in the discretion of Brazil, and
in this age no power can be justified in any exercise of
discretion adverse to human freedom.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Americanus.</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="medium">

<p>The article was answered by an able writer in the <i>Advertiser</i> of December
13th, who assumed that Mr. Sumner was the apologist of seizures
in neutral waters. It was also severely criticized by Professor
Goldwin Smith, then travelling among us, in a letter which was given
to the newspapers. Mr. Sumner, whose special object was to anticipate
British criticism and to smooth the way with Brazil, said nothing
until the case was understood to be settled, when he reappeared
in the <i>Advertiser</i> of January 17, 1865.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<h3>SUPPLEMENT.</h3>

<p>The recent correspondence between Mr. Seward and
the Brazilian Chargé d’Affaires at Washington seems
to bring the case of the Florida to a close. Our Government
has distinctly recognized the inviolability of
territorial sovereignty, and made reparation for the
original act of violence, so much discussed. The vessel
itself, out of which the question arose, was no longer
in existence; so that the only important point not
already settled by principle and precedent was eliminated
from the case. There was no vessel to be claimed
on the one side or refused on the other, and nothing
was said of damages on account of its loss. Of course,
had the Florida belonged to Brazil, any reparation
would have been incomplete which did not embrace
the vessel or its value.</p>

<p>But Mr. Seward has been careful to exclude the assumption
that the Rebels have belligerent rights on the
ocean, and also the other assumption that the Florida
was anything but a pirate. It is clear that the position
taken on these two points must have influenced any
decision with regard to the vessel itself, or damages on
account of its loss.</p>

<p>As the case is now settled, it is unnecessary to consider
objections adduced against the view presented by
me in the “Advertiser” some weeks ago. What is now
certain was then uncertain. The Government has spoken,
and the country accepts the result. But it may not
be unprofitable to return for one moment to the original
discussion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>My object at that time was to furnish materials for
final judgment, and especially to repel British objurgations
which befogged the whole question. It was important
that our national conduct should be determined
calmly, according to the best principles, and with perfect
knowledge of the past. But it is difficult to deal
with this or any kindred question without repairing to
British history. There are precedents to be shunned
as well as to be followed, and both should be studied.
It is strange that such an attempt should have been
misunderstood. Perhaps it is stranger still that anybody
should have insisted on our humble submission
to the most opprobrious epithets, without reminding
the objurgators of the history of their own country,
bristling with incidents <i>having in them all that was
indefensible in the Florida case without any of its exceptional
circumstances</i>. A Roman poet exclaims:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Quis tulerit Gracchos de seditione querentes?”<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And another authority, which will not be questioned,
expressly enjoins on the censor to extract the beam
from his own eye before he complains of the mote in
the eye of another.</p>

<p>In the excess of dissent from what I said, it was
even suggested that the vessel should be surrendered
to Brazil,&mdash;of course as trustee of Rebel Slavery.
But this was a very hasty suggestion, forgetting the
piratical origin of the vessel, and forgetting the piratical
slavemonger character of its pretended owners, having
no <i>ocean</i> rights. Admitting the inviolability of neutral
waters, it does not follow that such a vessel could
be claimed, or, if Brazil were so ill-advised as to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
such a claim, that our Government could hearken to it.
It was because I saw this clearly that I sought to set
up a breakwater against such claim, and to prepare
public opinion on the subject. It is noble in a nation
to acknowledge wrong; but it is weakness to sacrifice
a great cause.</p>

<p>The Statute of Limitations has been set up against
some of the historic instances adduced, and the very
recent date of the Congress of Paris, at the close of the
Crimean War in 1856, is declared to fix the line of demarcation,
marking an altered policy in Great Britain.
As a lover of peace and a student of International Law,
anxious for its advancement,&mdash;yielding to nobody in
this regard,&mdash;I wish that such an alteration could be
shown. Joyfully should I welcome it, as one of the
signs of a new order of ages. Unhappily, it cannot be
shown, and I feel sure that it can be brought about
only by a frank exhibition of transactions demonstrating
its necessity. Truth is illustrated by error, health
is maintained by knowledge of disease, and crime itself
is made repulsive by bringing its perpetrators to
judgment.</p>

<p>It is an old adage of the law, that no statute of limitations
runs against the sovereign,&mdash;<i>Nullum tempus
occurrit regi</i>. This, of course, is for the protection of
his interests. But, assuming that such a statute may
be pleaded against British responsibility for historic
precedents more than eight years old, there is no question
with regard to what has occurred since. Here
the responsibility is admitted. Now, confining ourselves
to the brief period since the Crimean Peace,
there are instances identical in character with those
which occurred previously; and these are the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
remarkable as Great Britain had not the apology of
war to disturb her equanimity.</p>

<p>A well-informed person, writing from Berlin, furnishes
the following instance, which occurred as late
as 1860. “Two British men-of-war took, or at least
threatened to take, the Paraguayan war-steamer Tacuaril,
in the port of Buenos Ayres. They laid themselves
on each side of the Paraguayan war-steamer, in order
to enforce a claim which proved afterwards to be fallacious.”
The writer adds, that “this case, if looked into
closely, will probably serve as a counter argument,
should England have anything to say on the Florida-Bahia
affair.” True enough; and such is the recent
judgment of a German publicist.</p>

<p>There is also that other historic instance which has
among its incidents the suspension of diplomatic relations
between Brazil and Great Britain. It began with
a demand by the latter power for reparation on account
of a vessel pillaged after shipwreck on the coast of Brazil,
in June, 1861. This was complicated soon after by
a quarrel between certain officers of a British frigate in
the harbor of Rio Janeiro and a sentry on shore, which
ended in taking the officers into custody. The British
minister demanded reparation for these two alleged
wrongs; and the British admiral, who was at hand,
seized five Brazilian merchant-vessels in the harbor of
Rio Janeiro, declaring that he would not release them
until £6,500 had been paid on account of the pillaged
vessel, and satisfaction afforded for the detention of the
officers. Thus, in time of peace, without any declaration
of war, the British admiral performed an act of war,
like that in the case of the Florida, but without the
apology of the captors of the latter vessel. In short,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
he undertook, within the territorial jurisdiction of Brazil,
to seize, not one vessel, but five vessels,&mdash;and all
these innocent, neither piratical in origin nor belonging
to people without <i>ocean</i> rights. Brazil, succumbing to
superior force, paid the money demanded, and referred
the question of reparation in the case of the officers to
the arbitration of King Leopold of Belgium, who has
since rendered judgment for the weaker power. The
question of responsibility for the five innocent vessels
seized within the territorial jurisdiction of Brazil was
left unsettled. The mild and accomplished minister of
Brazil in London, M. Carvalho Moreira, made a reclamation
on this account, in a careful note, dated May 5,
1863, where he submitted, that “the English Government
should express its regret at the acts which accompanied
the reprisals, and declare that it had no intention
to offend the dignity or to violate the territorial
sovereignty of the empire,” and that it should consent
to refer the question of damages to arbitration. Earl
Russell declining to reopen any part of the questions
between the two Governments, or to enter into any
explanations, the Brazilian minister at once demanded
his passports and left London. This case will be
found at length in an authentic publication, which has
only recently appeared.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> I leave it, simply quoting
from the work these pertinent words:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> “The question
was with regard to the reparation and compensation
which Brazil demanded from England for the seizure
of her merchant-vessels and for the violation of her territorial
waters.… It was, unhappily, easy to foresee
the issue of this question,&mdash;England being always
more disposed to demand reparation and indemnities
than to accord them.”<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Such is the recent judgment
of a French publicist.</p>

<p>There is another case, which has not yet found its
way into the books, nor did it occur after the Crimean
War; but it is so very recent, and so curious, that I
venture to adduce it. I am indebted for it to the Hon.
John B. Alley, one of our Representatives in Congress,
to whom it was communicated by one of his constituents.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
The bark Home, of Boston, was on her way
from Calcutta to Boston, when, on or about August 22,
1849, she fell in with a vessel, first supposed to be a
pirate, but at last proved to be the Polka, prize to the
British steamer Sharpshooter, with the crew in a starving
condition. The prize-master, on coming aboard,
said that the prize was taken in Port Macahé, near Cape
Frio, in Brazil, for being engaged in the slave-trade;
that, to escape the fire of the fort, which opened on the
captors, they slipped the cable, and cut adrift the boat
which was made fast astern; that at the time of the
capture there was no person aboard, except a single
negro; and that a midshipman with ten men was put
aboard to take her to St. Helena. The famished crew
were supplied by the American bark with bread, beef,
water, and other small stores, for which the British
Government paid, in 1852, the cost price, being all
that was asked. On this case the master of the bark,
in his communication to Mr. Alley, remarks:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> “This is
another instance where a vessel was taken in a port
by the British, and this in a time of profound peace;
and as the fort fired on them, I presume the capture
was not made by consent of the Brazilian Government.”
Such is the mild conclusion of an American shipmaster,
who seems to see the conduct of Great Britain in
the same light as it is seen by the publicist of Germany
and the publicist of France.</p>

<p>Such instances, so recent, show how little the injunction
of International Law has been regarded by
Great Britain, whether before or after the Crimean
War; and yet British censors have not hesitated to
arraign the United States in brutal terms. I do not
admit their competency to sit in judgment on us; I
plead to the jurisdiction. If they would teach correct
principles, they must begin by a correct example.
Meanwhile the abuses for which Great Britain is responsible
cannot be forgotten by those who sincerely
desire a new era in International Law. I say this in
no spirit of reproach or controversy, but simply to
serve the cause of my country and of truth.</p>

<h2><a name="RELATIONS_WITH_GREAT_BRITAIN" id="RELATIONS_WITH_GREAT_BRITAIN"></a>RELATIONS WITH GREAT BRITAIN:
THE ST. ALBANS RAID.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech in the Senate, on a Bill for Fortifications and Batteries
on the Lakes, December 19, 1864.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>December 19th, Mr. Doolittle, of Wisconsin, introduced a bill to enable
the President to expend the sum of ten million dollars, or so much
thereof as might be necessary, in his opinion, in building fortifications
and floating-batteries to defend our northern frontier and the commerce
of the Lakes against the attacks of piratical and hostile expeditions organized
in the British provinces by the enemies of the United States;
and he moved the reference of the bill to the Committee on Finance,
which, at the suggestion of Mr. Sumner, he changed to the Committee
on Foreign Relations. A debate ensued, involving what were called the
troubles on the border, and especially the “St. Albans Raid,” when a
hostile expedition crossed from Canada into Vermont, and committed
acts of violence in that town. Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;The question before the Senate
is simply on the reference of this bill. It is
a question of the order of business.</p>

<p>Looking at its character, it is plain that it concerns
primarily and essentially our foreign relations. This
circumstance gives it a peculiar interest. If it concerned
only an additional levy of troops, or the building
of new forts, or a change in our commercial policy, there
would be no question with regard to its reference, nor
would the Senator from Maryland [Mr. <span class="smcap">Reverdy Johnson</span>]
have followed it by remarks on the outrage at St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Albans. I assume, then, that it concerns our foreign
relations, and therefore, according to the usages of the
Senate, should be referred to the committee having that
subject in charge.</p>

<p>This is all I have to say on the question of reference;
but the Senate will pardon me, if I glance for one
moment at the outrage to which the Senator referred.
Only a few weeks ago, the village of St. Albans, in Vermont,
was disturbed by a band of murderers, highwaymen,
house-breakers, horse-thieves, and bank-robbers,
from Canada. After breaking open the banks and obtaining
a certain amount of spoil, attended by the murder
of a citizen, they succeeded in making their way
back to Canada, where they declared themselves agents
of the Rebel Government. Such are the main facts.
Now, Mr. President, does any one suppose that these
agents of the Rebel Government were moved to this
criminal enterprise merely by considerations of plunder?&mdash;that
they risked life and everything merely to
rob a bank? No such thing. Their object was much
higher and more comprehensive. It was to embroil the
Government of the United States with the Government
of Great Britain. I cannot doubt that such was their
object. To my mind it is plain as noonday.</p>

<p>These agents, or rather the men behind who set them
on, knew the sensitiveness of our people, and how naturally
they would be aroused against the foreign country
where the enterprise had its origin. They saw that
excitement, passion, anger on our part were inevitable,
that out of these some complication or collision might
ensue, and that any such complication or collision must
necessarily help the Rebellion more than a victory on
the field of battle. All this they saw, and acted accordingly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
The whole proceeding was a trap in which
to catch the Government of our country. It was hoped
that in this way the Rebellion might gain that powerful
British intervention which would restore its failing
fortunes.</p>

<p>For myself, Sir, I am determined not to be caught in
any such trap. There are many things Great Britain
has done, since the outbreak of our Rebellion, which to
my mind are most unfriendly; but I am unwilling that
there should be anything on our side to furnish seeming
apology for that foreign intervention so constantly
menaced, and originally foreshadowed in the most hasty
and utterly unjustifiable concession of ocean belligerence
to Rebel Slavemongers who had not a single port
or prize court. Nobody sees the wrongs we have suffered
more clearly than I do; but I see other wrongs
also. While never ceasing to claim all our just rights,
and reminding this power always of duties plainly neglected,
I cannot forget that we are engaged in a war for
the suppression of a long-continued and most virulent
Rebellion, which has thus far tasked our best energies.
To this work let us dedicate ourselves, without arousing
another enemy, through whose alliance the Rebellion
may be encouraged and strengthened. Let us put
down the Rebellion. Do this, and we shall do everything.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I trust the Senate will not be moved by
passion into hasty action on any of the measures before
it, but that each will be considered carefully and calmly
on its merits, according to the usage of this body. This
surely is the dictate of prudence, and I cannot doubt
that it is the dictate of patriotism also.</p>

<p>Washington, in his Farewell Address, warns against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
“the insidious wiles of foreign influence”; but the “insidious
wiles” of our Rebels, seeking to embroil us with
foreign powers, are as deadly as any influence brought
against us. Forewarned is forearmed. Let us be steadfast
against them.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>After further debate, in which Mr. Sumner considered the order of
General Dix, authorizing our troops to pursue a hostile expedition into
Canada, according to writers on International Law, the bill was referred
to the Committee on Foreign Relations, where, with other similar
measures, it was allowed to sleep.</p>

TREATY.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speeches in the Senate, on the Joint Resolution giving Notice
for the Termination of the Canadian Reciprocity Treaty,
December 21, 1864, January 11 and 12, 1865.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>A joint resolution passed the House of Representatives, December
13, 1864, which, after an argumentative preamble, authorized
and requested the President of the United States to give the British
Government the notice required by the fifth article of the Reciprocity
Treaty of the 5th June, 1854, for the termination of the same; and in
the Senate the same was duly referred to the Committee on Foreign
Relations.</p>

<p>December 20, 1864, Mr. Sumner reported from the Committee the
House resolution, with the following substitute as an amendment.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Joint Resolution</span> providing for the termination of the Reciprocity Treaty
of fifth June, eighteen hundred and fifty-four, between the United States
and Great Britain.</p>

<p>“Whereas it is provided in the Reciprocity Treaty concluded at Washington
the 5th of June, 1854, between the United States, of the one part, and
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, of the other part, that this
treaty ‘shall remain in force for ten years from the date at which it may
come into operation, and further until the expiration of twelve months after
either of the high contracting parties shall give notice to the other of its wish
to terminate the same’; and whereas it appears, by a proclamation of the
President of the United States, bearing date 16th March, 1855, that the
treaty came into operation on that day; and whereas, further, it is no
longer for the interests of the United States to continue the same in force:
Therefore</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved, by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
of America, in Congress assembled</i>, That notice be given of the termination
of the Reciprocity Treaty, according to the provision therein contained for
the termination of the same; and the President of the United States is
hereby charged with the communication of such notice to the Government
of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>December 21st, the joint resolution was, on motion of Mr. Sumner,
taken up for consideration, when the substitute was adopted as an
amendment. The question occurring on the passage of the joint resolution
as amended, Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I had originally intended,
when this joint resolution came up, to review
the whole subject, and to exhibit at length the history
of the Reciprocity Treaty, and existing reasons for its
termination. But, after the debate of a few days ago,
and considering the apparent unanimity in the Senate,
I feel unwilling to occupy time by any protracted
remarks. They are not needed.</p>

<p>The people of the United States have been uneasy
under the Reciprocity Treaty for several years,&mdash;I may
almost say from its date. A feeling early showed itself
that the treaty was more advantageous to Canada than
to the United States,&mdash;that, in short, it was unilateral.
This feeling has of late ripened into something like
conviction. At the same time the exigencies of the
present war, requiring so large an expenditure, make it
unreasonable for us to continue a treaty by which the
revenues of the country suffer. Such considerations
have brought the public mind to its present position.
The unamiable feelings manifested toward us by the
people of Canada have had little influence on the question,
unless, perhaps, they may conspire to make us
look at it in the light of reason rather than of sentiment.</p>

<p>The subject of the fisheries is included in this treaty.
But it is not doubted that before the termination of
the treaty some arrangement can be made in regard
to it, either by reciprocal legislation or by further negotiation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>The Committee, after careful consideration at a full
meeting, was unanimous in its report. And as the
Committee represents all parts of the country and all
sentiments of the Senate, I have thought that perhaps
there might be a similar unanimity among Senators.
Therefore I forbear all further remarks, and ask for a
vote.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>On motion of Mr. Hale, of New Hampshire, the further consideration
of the question was postponed.</p>

<p>January 11, 1865, it was resumed, when Mr. Hale spoke against
the notice. He was followed by Mr. Sumner.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;The Reciprocity Treaty has a
beautiful name. It suggests at once exchange, equality,
equity; and it is because it was supposed to advance
these ideas practically that this treaty was originally
accepted by the people of the United States. If,
however, it shall appear, that, while organizing an exchange,
it forgets equality and equity in any essential
respect, then must a modification be made in conformity
with just principles.</p>

<p>I mean to be brief, but I hope, though brief, to make
the proper conclusion apparent. It is a question for
reason, and not for passion or sentiment, and in this
spirit I enter upon the discussion.</p>

<p>The treaty may be seen under four different heads,
as it concerns, first, the fisheries,&mdash;secondly, the navigation
of the St. Lawrence,&mdash;thirdly, the commerce
between the United States and the British provinces,&mdash;and,
fourthly, the revenue of the United States.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>1. The fisheries have been a source of anxiety
throughout our history, even from the beginning, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
for several years previous to the Reciprocity Treaty
they had been the occasion of mutual irritation, verging
at times on positive outbreak. The treaty was followed
by entire tranquillity, which has not been for a moment
disturbed. This is a plain advantage not to be denied.
But, so far as I have been able to examine official returns,
I do not find any further evidence showing the
value of the treaty in this connection, while opinions,
even among those most interested in the fisheries, are
divided. There are partisans for it in Gloucester, and
partisans against it in Maine.</p>

<p>If the treaty related exclusively to the fisheries, I
should not be willing to touch it,&mdash;although the circumstance
that representatives of these interests differ with
regard to its value may leave it open to debate. But
the practical question remains, whether any seeming
advantage in this respect is sufficient to counterbalance
the disadvantage in other respects.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>2. Next comes the navigation of the St. Lawrence.
This plausible concession has proved to be little more
than a name. It appears that during the first six years
of the treaty only forty American vessels, containing
12,550 tons, passed seaward through the St. Lawrence,
and during the same time only nineteen vessels, containing
5,446 tons, returned by the same open highway.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
These are very petty amounts, when we consider
the commerce on the Lakes, which in 1856 was
estimated at $587,197,320,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> or when we, consider the
carrying trade between the United States and the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
provinces. Take the years 1857-62, and we find
that during this period the shipping of the United
States clearing for the British provinces was 10,707,329
tons, and the foreign shipping clearing during this same
period was 7,391,399 tons, while the shipping of the
United States entering at our custom-houses from the
British provinces was 10,056,183 tons, and the foreign
shipping entering was 6,453,520 tons.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> I mention these
things by way of contrast. In comparison with these
grand movements of value, the business we have been
able to do on the St. Lawrence is trivial. It need not
be considered an element in the present discussion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>3. The treaty may be seen next in its bearing on the
commerce between the two countries. This has increased
immensely; but it is difficult to say how much
of this increase is due to the treaty, and how much to
the natural growth of population, and the facilities of
transportation in both countries. If it could be traced
exclusively or in any large measure to the treaty, it
would be an element not to be disregarded. But it
does not follow from the occurrence of this increase
<i>after</i> the treaty that it was <i>on account</i> of the treaty.
<i>Post hoc, ergo propter hoc</i>, is too loose a rule for our
Government on the present occasion.</p>

<p>The census of the United States and of the British
provinces shows an increase of population which must
not be disregarded in determining the origin of this
increase of commerce.</p>

<p>There are also the railroads, with prompt and constant
means of intercommunication, which have come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
into successful operation only since the treaty. It
would be difficult to exaggerate the influence they
have exercised in quickening and extending commerce.
I cannot doubt that the railroad system of the two
countries has been in itself a Reciprocity Treaty more
comprehensive and equal than any written on parchment.</p>

<p>The extent of trade before and after the treaty is
seen in a few figures.</p>

<p>In the three years immediately preceding the treaty
the total exports to Canada and the other British provinces
were $48,216,518, and the total imports were
$22,588,577,&mdash;being of exports to imports in the proportion
of one hundred to forty-six.</p>

<p>In the ten years of the treaty the total exports to Canada
and the other British provinces were $256,350,931,
and the total imports were $200,399,786. According
to these amounts the exports were to the imports
in the proportion of one hundred to seventy-eight.
Taking Canada alone, we find the change in this proportion
greater still. The total exports to Canada in
the three years immediately preceding the treaty were
$31,846,865, and the total imports were $16,589,624,
being in the proportion of one hundred to fifty-two,&mdash;while
the total exports to Canada alone during the ten
years of the treaty were $170,371,911, and the total
imports were $161,474,349, being in the proportion of
one hundred to ninety-four.</p>

<p>I present these tables simply to lay before you the
extent and nature of the change in the commerce between
the two countries. I forbear embarking on the
much debated inquiry as to the effect of a difference
between the amount of exports and of imports, involving,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
as it does, the most delicate question of the balance
of trade. In the comparison I am making, it is
not necessary to consider it. The Reciprocity Treaty
cannot be maintained or overturned on any contested
principle of political economy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>4. I come, in the last place, to the influence of the
treaty on the revenue of our country; and here the
custom-house is our principal witness. The means of
determining this question are found in the authentic
tables published from time to time in Reports of the
Treasury, and especially in the report to Congress at
this session, which I have in my hand.</p>

<p>Looking at these tables, we find certain unanswerable
points. I begin with an estimate founded on the trade
before the treaty. From this it appears, that, if no
treaty had been made, and the trade had increased in
the same ratio as before the treaty, Canada would have
paid to the United States in the ten years of the treaty
at least $16,373,880, from which she has been relieved.
This sum is actually lost to the revenue of the United
States. In return, Canada has given up $2,650,890,
being the amount it would have collected, if no treaty
had been made. This vast disproportion is to the detriment
of the national revenue.</p>

<p>Here is another illustration, derived from the tables.
During the ten years of the treaty the United States have
actually paid in duties to Canada alone $16,802,962,
while during this same period Canada has paid in
duties to the United States the very moderate sum of
$930,447. Here again is vast disproportion, to the
detriment of the national revenue.</p>

<p>The same inequality is seen in another way. During<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
the ten years of the treaty <i>dutiable</i> products of the
United States have entered Canada and the other provinces
to the amount of $84,347,019, while during this
same period <i>dutiable</i> products of Canada and the other
provinces have entered the United States only to the
amount of $7,750,482. During this same period <i>free
products</i> of the United States have entered Canada and
the other provinces to the amount of $118,853,972,
while <i>free products</i> of Canada and the other provinces
have entered the United States to the amount of
$178,500,184. Here, again, is vast disproportion to
the detriment of the national revenue.</p>

<p>Add to these various results the statement of the
Secretary of the Treasury, just laid on our tables, in the
following words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The treaty [during the eight fiscal years 1855-63] has
released from duty a total sum of $42,333,257 in value
of goods of Canada more than of goods the produce of the
United States.”<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This conclusion is in substantial harmony with that
reached from an independent examination of the tables.</p>

<p>These various illustrations show that the revenue of
the United States has suffered by the treaty, and that
in this important particular its advantages are not
shared equally by the two countries. Here, at least,
it loses title to its name.</p>

<p>But its onerous character has become manifest in
other forms since the adoption of our system of internal
revenue. I need not remind the Senate of the extent
to which we have gone in seeking out objects of excise,&mdash;and
there are pending propositions in the same direction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
seeking new objects; but it is notorious that such
taxation is always graduated with reference to the tariff
on the same objects, when imported from abroad. But
here the Reciprocity Treaty steps forward with imperative
veto. Thus, for instance, the lumber of our country
is left free from excise, though I am assured it
might well bear it, simply because no countervailing
tax can be imposed upon lumber from the British provinces.
Had a tax of five per cent been imposed upon
the lumber of our country, I am assured, by those familiar
with the subject, that we should have received at
least $5,000,000,&mdash;all of which is lost to our annual
revenue. This is only a single illustration.</p>

<p>There are other ways in which the treaty and our
excise system come into conflict. Practical difficulties,
I am assured, have already occurred in the Bureau of
Internal Revenue. This conflict is seen in the extent
to which the business of the country, and even its agriculture,
is taxed now. Everything is taxed. Even the
farmer works now with taxed tools. These considerations,
with the increased value of labor among us, must
give new advantages to the productive interests of Canada
as compared with ours, and tend still further to the
unequal operation of the treaty. Even admitting its
original equality, you cannot deny that the vicissitudes
of war, in these latter days, have worked changes requiring
new arrangements and adaptations.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. President, such is the result of a candid inquiry
into the operation of this treaty, as it concerns the fisheries,
the navigation of the St. Lawrence, the commerce
of the two countries, and the revenue of the United
States. I have kept back nothing favorable to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
treaty that could be adequately stated in the brief
space I have allowed myself, nor have I exaggerated
its unequal operation.</p>

<p>And now the question is, Shall this condition of
things be readjusted? The treaty itself, as if anticipating
this exigency, furnishes the opportunity, by expressly
providing for its termination at the expiration
of ten years, on notice of one year from either party.
Great Britain is free to give this notice; so are the
United States. Considering the present state of the
country, it would seem improvident not to give the
notice. We must husband our resources; nor can a
foreign Government justly expect us to continue a
treaty which is a drain upon our revenue. We are
turning in all directions for subjects of taxation. Our
own people are contributing largely in every way.
Commerce, manufactures in every form, come to the
assistance of the country. I know no reason why the
large amounts enfranchised by this treaty should enjoy
the immunity thus far conceded. An inequality which
in ordinary times might escape observation becomes
too apparent in the blaze of present responsibilities.</p>

<p>Something has been said about accompanying the
proposed notice with instructions to negotiate a new
treaty. This is unnecessary. A new treaty may not
be advisable. It is possible that the whole matter
may be settled by Congress under general laws. At all
events, there is a full year from the 16th of March next
in which to provide a substitute, either by diplomacy
or by legislation. And this remark is applicable to the
fisheries, as well as to every other interest touched by
the treaty. I cannot doubt that the two contracting
parties will approach the whole business in the determination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
to settle it on the permanent foundations of
justice and equity; but the first step in this direction is
the notice to terminate the existing treaty.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>In the debate which ensued, Mr. Sherman, of Ohio, Mr. Collamer,
of Vermont, Mr. Morrill, of Maine, Mr. Chandler, of Michigan, Mr.
Foot, of Vermont, Mr. Doolittle, of Wisconsin, Mr. Farwell, of Maine,
Mr. Conness, of California, Mr. Wilson, of Massachusetts, Mr. Cowan,
of Pennsylvania, Mr. Riddle, of Delaware, and Mr. Richardson, of
Illinois, spoke in favor of the notice; Mr. Ramsey, of Minnesota, Mr.
Howe, of Wisconsin, Mr. Hale, of New Hampshire, and Mr. Hendricks,
of Indiana, spoke against it.</p>

<p>January 12th, Mr. Sumner spoke again.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;The proposition to terminate the
Reciprocity Treaty has been mystified in various ways.
There has been mystification because it came from the
Committee on Foreign Relations, as if that committee,
to which are referred all treaties and questions with foreign
powers, was not the proper committee to consider
it, according to the usages and traditions of the Senate.
Pray, what other committee could so justly deal
with it?</p>

<p>There has also been illusiveness in argument, by accumulation
of statistics and figures without end. We
have been treated to calculations, showing the increase
of commerce since the treaty, and also the relative increase
of exports and imports. To these calculations I
am no stranger; but, after careful study, I am satisfied
that it is impossible to find in them any <i>terra firma</i> on
which to stand. They are little better than quicksand,
or a deceptive mirage.</p>

<p>In the remarks which I submitted to the Senate yesterday
I declined to dwell on these calculations, for I
saw, that, while involving large amounts, they were uncertain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
inconclusive, and inapplicable. With one theory
of political economy they seemed to point one way,
and with another to point another way. If, for instance,
you accept the early theory that commerce is
disadvantageous where imports exceed exports, they
tell against the treaty; but if you accept the opposite
theory of later writers, they tell the other way. All
this assumes that they are applicable. But nobody is
able to show that the general increase of commerce since
the treaty has been caused by the treaty. Other agencies
have had their influence; and it is difficult to say
what is due to them, and what to the treaty.</p>

<p>In this uncertainty, I prefer to rest the proposition
on the simple ground that the national revenue is impaired
by this treaty. Authentic figures place this beyond
controversy.</p>

<p>I forbear now all details, and content myself with
stating the indubitable conclusion. The national revenue
is impaired in two ways: first, at the custom-house
on our frontier, which, under the operation of the
treaty, yields little or nothing, when it might yield
much; and, secondly, it is impaired through the check
and embarrassment the treaty causes in our internal
taxation. There is failure of duties and of excise. It
is not enough to say that there is a countervailing advantage
in the increase of our commerce. The conclusion
is none the less exact, that the national revenue is
impaired. And the question is distinctly presented,
whether, at this critical moment, in a period of war,
when the whole country in its wealth and labor is contributing
to the support of Government, any good reason
can be assigned why the commerce of Canada
should be exempt from contribution. Commerce elsewhere,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
manufactures, business, income, tea, coffee, books,
all pay tribute. The tax-gatherer is everywhere except
on the Canadian frontier. At home there is not
an interest, hardly a sentiment, free from taxation.
Surely there is nothing in the recent conduct of Canadians
to make us treat them better than we treat ourselves.</p>

<p>There is another consideration which is decisive, even
if others fail. In view of existing Public Opinion, and
considering the criticisms of the treaty, it is important
that our relations with Canada should be carefully revised
in the light of experience. The treaty, in authorizing
its termination at the end of ten years, has anticipated
this very exigency. But such revision cannot be
made advantageously without the proposed notice. In
the case of a lease, with a right to terminate it at the
end of ten years on a year’s notice, the landlord, if the
character of the lease had been called in question, would
not hesitate to give the notice, if for no other reason,
that he might revise the terms anew on a footing of
equality. For like reason we must give the notice to
Great Britain. We must untie ourselves now, even if
we would tie ourselves again for the future. The notice
will leave us “master of the situation” to this extent
at least, that we shall be free to act according to the
requirements of the public good. Without this notice
there will be no foothold for diplomacy or legislation;
but the notice will be a foothold from which we may
accomplish whatever is proper and just. The treaty
may be reconsidered and then adopted anew, or it may
be entirely changed, and we shall have a year for this
purpose,&mdash;so that, when the Old expires, the New may
begin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The joint resolution directing the notice was adopted in the Senate,&mdash;Yeas
33, Nays 8,&mdash;and was at once adopted by the House of Representatives,
and approved by the President January 18, 1865. It was then
communicated by Mr. Seward to Mr. Adams, our minister at London,
who, under date of March 17th, addressed a note to Earl Russell, “giving
formal notice of the termination of the Reciprocity Treaty, and inclosing
at the same time a certified copy of the resolution expressing
the sense of both Houses of Congress on that subject.” Mr. Adams
adds, in his letter to Mr. Seward: “This note was delivered by the
messenger of this Legation at the Foreign Office at 2 <span class="smcapuc">P. M.</span>, notice of
which was entered by him on the envelope, and also reported to me on
his return. Not long afterwards I received from his Lordship his own
acknowledgment of the reception of it.”<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

January 5, 1865.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>As early as January 8, 1864, Mr. Wilson, of Massachusetts, embodied
in a bill to promote enlistments a clause declaring, that, when any
man or boy of African descent, owing service or labor in any State,
under its laws, shall be mustered into the military or naval service of
the United States, he and his mother, wife, and children shall be forever
free. This bill was considered from time to time. March 18th,
Mr. Sherman, of Ohio, moved to postpone the bill, “with a view that
we may act upon the main proposition, the Amendment to the Constitution
to abolish Slavery in the United States.” Mr. Sumner replied:
“The Senator speaks about acting on ‘the main proposition.’ The
main proposition, Sir, is to strike Slavery wherever you can hit it.”
That session closed without final action on the question.</p>

<p>December 13, 1864, Mr. Wilson brought it forward again, in a joint
resolution to encourage enlistments and promote the efficiency of the
military and naval forces, by making free the wives and children of
persons who had been or might be mustered into the service of the
United States.</p>

<p>January 5, 1865, in the debate which ensued, Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;Only a few days ago there
was a call for three hundred thousand more
troops. The country needs them, and it is the duty of
Congress to supply them. To this end there must be
no difficulty, impediment, or embarrassment in the way.
All these must be removed. This is not all. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
must be encouragement of every kind; and such is the
character of the present proposition.</p>

<p>There can be no delay. The country cannot wait
the slow action of Constitutional Amendment, as proposed
by the Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. <span class="smcap">Doolittle</span>].
Congress must act to the extent of its power, and any
neglect of power on this question would be injurious
to the public interests.</p>

<p>All will confess the humanity of the proposition to
enfranchise the families of colored persons who have
borne arms for their country. All will confess the
hardship of continuing them in Slavery.</p>

<p>But the question is asked by many, and even by the
Senator from Wisconsin, What power has Congress to
set the families free?</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Doolittle.</span> I did not ask that question.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> The question has been put again and
again, and the purport of the speech of the Senator was
in that sense. He argued that we were about to have
a Constitutional Amendment which would supersede
everything; that therefore this proposition was unnecessary,
if not injurious. I so understood the argument
of the Senator, and that it pointed directly to the question
of power,&mdash;because I know the patriotism of the
Senator too well to suppose, that, if in his opinion the
power of Congress was beyond doubt, he would hesitate.
I do not do the Senator injustice. I say, then,
the question is asked, What power has Congress to set
the families free? This is the single point on which I
shall express an opinion.</p>

<p>My answer is, that Congress has precisely the same
power to enfranchise the families that it has to enfranchise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
the colored soldier. The two powers are coincident,
and from the same source.</p>

<p>It is assumed that Congress may enfranchise the colored
soldier. This has been done by solemn statute,
without reference to the conduct of his pretended
owner. If we are asked the reason for such enfranchisement,
it must be found, first, in its practical necessity,
that we may secure the best service of the slaves,
and, secondly, in its intrinsic justice and humanity. In
brief, Government cannot be so improvident and so
foolish as to seek the service of the slave at the hazard
of life, without securing to him the boon of freedom.
Nor, if Government were so bereft of common sense as
to forego this temptation to enlistment and efficient service,
can it be guilty of the unutterable meanness of
using the slave in the national defence and then returning
him to bondage. Therefore the slave who fights is
enfranchised.</p>

<p>But every argument, every consideration, which
pleads for the enfranchisement of the slave, pleads also
for the enfranchisement of the family. There is the
same practical necessity for doing it, and the same unspeakable
shabbiness in not doing it.</p>

<p>There is no principle of law better established than
this, that an acknowledged right carries with it all incidents
essential to its exercise. I do not employ technical
language; but I give the idea, founded in reason
and the nature of things. It would be vain to confer
a right or a power, if the means for its enjoyment were
denied. From this simple statement the conclusion is
irresistible.</p>

<p>In conferring upon Congress the power to create
an army, the Constitution conferred therewith all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
powers essential to the exercise of the principal power.
If Congress can authorize the enlistment of slaves, as
it indubitably can, it may at the same time authorize
their enfranchisement, and by the same reason it may
authorize the enfranchisement of their families,&mdash;and
all this from the necessity of the case, and to prevent
an intolerable baseness.</p>

<p>A Scottish patriot, nearly two centuries ago, exclaimed
in memorable words, which I am always glad
to quote, that he would give his life to serve his country,
but would not do <i>a base thing</i> to save it.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> If there be
any value in this declaration, it may be invoked, when it
is deliberately argued that the National Government can
create an army, and in this service can enfranchise the
slave it enlists, but is impotent to enfranchise his family.
I know not how we can use his right arm and ask
him to shed his blood in our defence, and then hand
over his wife and child to bondage. The thought is too
vile. The human heart rejects the insufferable wrong.</p>

<p>But it is said the slave has no family. Such is the
argument of Slavery. For all that he has, as well as
all that he is, even wife and child, belong to another.
Surely this unrighteous pretension will not be made the
apology for a denial of rights. If the family of the
slave be not designated by law, or by the forms of legal
marriage, <i>then it must be ascertained by the next best
evidence possible</i>,&mdash;that is, by cohabitation and mutual
recognition as man and wife. And any uncertainty in
this evidence can only be regarded as a natural incident
of Slavery. As men cannot take advantage of their own
wrong, so slave-masters cannot take advantage of Slavery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
Any other rule would practically unite with Slavery
in denying to the slave wife and child.</p>

<p>There is a well-known French maxim, that “it is
only the first step which costs”; and here permit me
to say, it is only the first stage of the argument which
merits attention. Concede that the soldier may be enfranchised,
and then by the same constitutional power
his family may be admitted to an equal liberty. Any
other conclusion would be illogical as inhuman, discreditable
alike to head and heart. There is no argument,
whether of reason or humanity, for the enfranchisement
of the soldier, which does not plead equally
for that of his family. Nay, more,&mdash;I know not how
we can expect a blessing on our arms while we fail to
perform this duty.</p>

<p>I cannot close without declaring again my opinion,
that Congress at this moment is complete master of
the whole subject of Slavery everywhere in the United
States, even without any Constitutional Amendment.
It can sweep all out of existence, precisely as it can
remove any other obstruction to the national defence,
and all this by virtue of a power as indisputable as the
power to raise armies or to suspend the <i>Habeas Corpus</i>.
Future generations will read with amazement, that a
great people, when national life was assailed, hesitated
to exercise a power so simple and beneficent; and this
amazement will know no bounds, as they learn that
Congress higgled for months on the question whether
the wives and children of our colored soldiers should be
admitted to freedom.</p>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Remarks in the Senate, on a Joint Resolution to Terminate
the Treaty of 1817 regulating the Naval Force on the
Lakes, January 18, 1865.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>January 18th, the Senate considered a joint resolution passed by
the House of Representatives, for the termination of the treaty between
the United States and Great Britain regulating the naval force
on the Lakes.</p>

<p>The resolution, as it was passed by the House of Representatives,
recited, that the Treaty of 1817, as to the naval force upon the Lakes,
was designed as a temporary arrangement only, and, although equal
and just at the time it was made, has become greatly unequal through
the construction by Great Britain of sundry ship-canals,&mdash;that the vast
interests of commerce upon the Northwestern Lakes, and the security of
cities and towns situated on their American borders, manifestly require
the establishment of one or more navy-yards wherein ships may be
fitted and prepared for naval warfare,&mdash;and that the United States Government,
unlike that of Great Britain, is destitute of ship-canals for the
transmission of gunboats from the Atlantic Ocean to the Western
Lakes,&mdash;and therefore proposed to direct the President of the United
States to give notice to the Government of Great Britain that it is the
wish and intention of the Government of the United States to terminate
the arrangement of 1817, in respect to the naval force upon the
Lakes, at the end of six months from and after giving the notice.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner, from the Committee on Foreign Relations, reported the
following substitute.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Joint Resolution</span> to terminate the Treaty of 1817, regulating the Naval
Force on the Lakes.</p>

<p>“<i>Whereas</i> the United States, of the one part, and the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Ireland, of the other part, by a treaty bearing date April,
1817, have regulated the naval force upon the Lakes, and it was further provided,
that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> ‘if either party should hereafter be desirous of annulling this
stipulation, and should give notice to that effect to the other party, it shall
cease to be binding after the expiration of six months from the date of such
notice’; and whereas the peace of our frontier is now endangered by hostile
expeditions against the commerce of the Lakes, and by other acts of lawless
persons, which the naval force of the two countries allowed by the existing
treaty may be insufficient to prevent; and whereas, further, the President
of the United States has proceeded to give the notice required for the termination
of the treaty by a communication which took effect on the 23d November,
1864: Therefore,</p>

<p>“<i>Be it resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled</i>, That the notice given by the President
of the United States to the Government of Great Britain and Ireland to
terminate the Treaty of 1817, regulating the naval force upon the Lakes, is
hereby adopted and ratified, as if the same had been authorized by Congress.”</p>

</div>

<p>The substitute was adopted, and the question was on the passage of
the resolution as amended.</p>

<p>As appears from the amended resolution, the President had already
given the notice for the termination of the treaty.</p>

<p>Mr. Davis, of Kentucky, opposed the resolution, on the ground
that the notice to terminate a treaty can be given only by Congress,&mdash;that
the President had no more power to give the notice than the
Judiciary,&mdash;and that his interference with the legislative power ought
to be condemned, instead of approved by adopting it.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner replied, that the difference between the Senator and the
Committee was of form; and he proceeded to read a communication,
bearing date November 23, 1864, from Mr. Adams to Earl Russell, setting
forth the grievances on our northern frontier, and giving formal
notice, that, “in conformity with the treaty reservation of the right,
at the expiration of six months from the date of this note the United
States will deem themselves at liberty to increase the naval armament
upon the Lakes, if in their judgment the condition of affairs in that
quarter shall then require it.” On this note was minuted: “Delivered
at the Foreign Office at fifteen minutes past six o’clock, <span class="smcapuc">P. M.</span>” In
considering the validity of the notice by the President, he referred
to authorities, showing that a treaty, like a law, could be repealed
only by the legislative power,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> and argued that notice to terminate it
must be given by the same power. Mr. Sumner further said:&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>
<p class="dropcap">But the Senator from Kentucky tells us that the
original defect in the notice by the President is
of such a character that it cannot be cured by any subsequent
ratification; and he proceeds to present what
he will excuse me if I call imaginary cases, which I
think could hardly occur, and are widely different from
that under consideration. I express no opinion on the
cases he does present,&mdash;as, for instance, if the President,
during the recess of Congress, should undertake to
involve the country in war. Let that case take care of
itself, when it arises for judgment. The case before us
is more simple, and is one with regard to which there
are no private rights or interests. It is a domestic
question between Congress and the President. He has
given the notice. As regards the Government of Great
Britain, that notice, I cannot doubt, is perfectly valid.
That Government will never call it in question. For
our own security, and that our precedents may conform
to just principles, we now propose by formal Act of
Congress to throw over this notice of the President the
shield of Congressional sanction; and the question is,
Can this be done? Can Congress, by an act of ratification,
impart to the original notice of the President that
power and character which, without subsequent ratification,
it would not have? On that point I content myself
with reading the authoritative words of the Supreme
Court of the United States in the decisions known as
the <i>Prize Cases</i>. There the Court express themselves
as follows.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Without admitting that such an act was necessary under
the circumstances, it is plain, that, if the President had
in any manner assumed powers which it was necessary
should have the authority or sanction of Congress, that, on
the well-known principle of law, ‘<i>Omnis ratihabitio retrotrahitur
et mandato æquiparatur</i>,’ this ratification has operated
to perfectly cure the defect. In the case of <i>Brown</i> v. <i>United
States</i>, (8 Cranch, 131, 132, 133,) Mr. Justice Story treats
of this subject, and cites numerous authorities, to which
we may refer, to prove this position, and concludes: ‘I am
perfectly satisfied that no subject can legally commit hostilities
or capture property of an enemy, when, either expressly
or constructively, the sovereign has prohibited it.
But suppose he does, I would ask if the sovereign may not
ratify his proceedings, and thus, by a retroactive operation,
give validity to them?’”<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>All now proposed is that Congress shall ratify the
notice to the British Government, and by retroactive
operation give validity to it.</p>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p>Mr. President, if this concerned private rights,&mdash;if,
according to the language of the Senator from Kentucky,
there were any question of <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i>,&mdash;there
might be force in his argument. But no private
rights are involved, and there are no private individuals
affected in any way by the proposed ratification of
the notice already given. Therefore I put out of view
that suggestion. It is, then, simply a question of power
on the part of Congress, with no question of private
rights.</p>

<p>I conclude that Congress has the power, and I put
my conclusion on two distinct grounds. The first is the
reason of the case, its common sense; for without this
power I can imagine difficulties or embarrassments in
the administration of government. I say the power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
must exist in Congress of ratifying, if it sees fit, certain
executive acts. The second ground is judicial
authority. The Supreme Court of the United States,
after careful consideration in recent cases which the
country knows received the amplest attention and were
most fully argued, has affirmed the power of Congress
to ratify an executive act which without such ratification
might otherwise be invalid. But I do not content
myself with referring to that single decision, recent and
authoritative as it is; I recall attention also to that
earlier decision which is adduced in the Prize Cases,
the case of <i>Brown</i> v. <i>The United States</i>, which is well
known to all lawyers as one of the best-reasoned judgments
in our books, and in that case you will find the
same power attributed to Congress.</p>

<p>Therefore, on grounds of reason and of authority, I
am not permitted to doubt that Congress may exercise
this power.</p>

</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>January 18th, Mr. Howard, of Michigan, from the Committee on
Military Affairs, reported the following joint resolution.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Joint Resolution</span>, advising Retaliation for the Cruel Treatment of
Prisoners by the Insurgents.</p>

<p>“<i>Whereas</i> it has come to the knowledge of Congress that great numbers
of our soldiers, who have fallen as prisoners of war into the hands of the insurgents,
have been subjected to treatment unexampled for cruelty in the
history of civilized war, and finding its parallels only in the conduct of savage
tribes,&mdash;a treatment resulting in the death of multitudes by the slow, but
designed, process of starvation, and by mortal diseases occasioned by insufficient
and unhealthy food, by wanton exposure of their persons to the inclemency
of the weather, and by deliberate assassination of innocent and
unoffending men, and the murder in cold blood of prisoners after surrender;
and whereas a continuance of these barbarities, in contempt of the laws of
war, and in disregard of the remonstrances of the national authorities, has
presented to us the alternative of suffering our brave soldiers thus to be
destroyed, or to apply the principle of retaliation for their protection;
Therefore,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
<p>“<i>Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
of America in Congress assembled</i>, That in the judgment of Congress it has
become justifiable and necessary that the President should, in order to prevent
the continuance and recurrence of such barbarities, and to insure the
observance by the insurgents of the laws of civilized war, resort at once to
measures of retaliation; that in our opinion such retaliation ought to be inflicted
upon the insurgent officers now in our hands, or hereafter to fall into
our hands, as prisoners; that such officers ought to be subjected to like treatment
practised towards our officers or soldiers in the hands of the insurgents,
in respect to quantity and quality of food, clothing, fuel, medicine,
medical attendance, personal exposure, or other mode of dealing with them;
that, with a view to the same ends, the insurgent prisoners in our hands
ought to be placed under the control and in the keeping of officers and men
who have themselves been prisoners in the hands of the insurgents, and have
thus acquired a knowledge of their mode of treating Union prisoners; that
explicit instructions ought to be given to the forces having the charge of
such insurgent prisoners, requiring them to carry out strictly and promptly
the principles of this resolution in every case, until the President, having
received satisfactory information of the abandonment by the insurgents of
such barbarous practices, shall revoke or modify said instructions. Congress
do not, however, intend by this resolution to limit or restrict the
power of the President to the modes or principles of retaliation herein mentioned,
but only to advise a resort to them as demanded by the occasion.”</p>

</div>

<p>January 23d, Mr. Wade, of Ohio, moved to proceed with its consideration,
when the following passage occurred.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wade.</span> I move to take up Senate resolution No. 97</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> What is it about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wade.</span> About retaliation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I would not go on with that to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wade.</span> You would, if you were in prison. [<i>Laughter.</i>]</p>

</div>

<p>The resolution was taken up and debated.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>January 24th, Mr. Sumner moved the following resolutions as a substitute.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That retaliation is harsh always, even in the simplest cases,
and is permissible only where, in the first place, it may be reasonably expected
to effect its object, and where, in the second place, it is consistent with the
usages of civilized society; and in the absence of these essential conditions,
it is a useless barbarism, having no other end than vengeance, which is forbidden
alike to nations and to men.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the treatment of our officers and soldiers in Rebel prisons
is cruel, savage, and heart-rending beyond precedent; that it is shocking
to morals; that it is an offence against human nature itself; that it adds
new guilt to the crime of the Rebellion, and constitutes an example from
which history will turn with sorrow and disgust.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That any attempted imitation of Rebel barbarism in the treatment
of prisoners is plainly impracticable, on account of its inconsistency
with the prevailing sentiments of humanity among us; that it would be injurious
at home, for it would barbarize the whole community; that it would
be utterly useless, for it could not affect the cruel authors of the revolting
conduct we seek to overcome; that it would be immoral, inasmuch as it
proceeded from vengeance alone; that it could have no other result than to
degrade the national character and the national name, and to bring down
upon our country the reprobation of history; and that, being thus impracticable,
useless, immoral, and degrading, it must be rejected as a measure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
retaliation, precisely as the barbarism of roasting or eating prisoners is
always rejected by civilized powers.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the United States, filled with grief and sympathy for
cherished fellow-citizens who, as officers and soldiers, have become the
victims of Heaven-defying outrage, hereby declare their solemn determination
to end this great iniquity by ending the Rebellion of which it is the natural
fruit; that, to secure this humane and righteous consummation, they
pledge anew their best energies and the resources of the whole people; and
they call upon all to bear witness that in this necessary warfare with barbarism
they renounce all vengeance and every evil example, and plant
themselves firmly on the sacred landmarks of Christian civilization, under
the protection of that God who is present with every prisoner, and enables
heroic souls to suffer for their country.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner addressed the Senate in support of his resolutions.
After analyzing the resolution of the Committee, and exhibiting its
character, he proceeded:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Now, Sir, I believe that the Senate will not venture,
in this age of Christian light, under any
inducement, under any provocation, to counsel the Executive
Government to enter into such open competition
with barbarism. Sir, the thing is impossible; it
must not be entertained. We cannot be cruel, or barbarous,
or savage, because the Rebels we now meet in
warfare are cruel, barbarous, and savage. We cannot
imitate the detested example. We find no precedent
for such retaliation in our own history nor in the history
of other nations. We find no precedent, I say, in
our own history. This question was one of the earliest
presented to General Washington after taking command
of the American forces at Cambridge. From his headquarters
there, under date of August 11, 1775, he addressed
a letter to General Gage, commander of the
British forces in Boston, which, as I believe, contains
the full extent to which a nation can honorably go;
and I must say, that, as I read it, I felt new pride in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
that commander who thus early in the discharge of his
great duties showed such insight into their proper limits
and responsibilities. Addressing General Gage, he
said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I understand that the officers engaged in the
cause of Liberty and their country, who by the fortune of
war have fallen into your hands, have been thrown indiscriminately
into a common jail appropriated for felons;
that no consideration has been had for those of the most
respectable rank, when languishing with wounds and sickness;
and that some have been even amputated in this
unworthy situation.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then, reminding the British commander of the cause
in which he was engaged, Washington continued:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“My duty now makes it necessary to apprise you that for
the future I shall regulate all my conduct towards those
gentlemen who are or may be in our possession exactly by
the rule you shall observe towards those of ours now in
your custody. If severity and hardship mark the line of
your conduct, painful as it may be to me, your prisoners
will feel its effects; but if kindness and humanity are shown
to ours, I shall with pleasure consider those in our hands
only as unfortunate, and they shall receive from me that
treatment to which the unfortunate are ever entitled.”<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Senators about me say, “That is sound.” I am glad
they say so; and if they can find in this correspondence
any sanction of the savage system now inaugurated in
Rebel prisons, let them point it out. The correspondence
has its own limitations in the statement of facts
on which it proceeds, which you will please observe.
Prisoners had been thrown indiscriminately into a common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
jail for felons, and with no consideration for those
of the most respectable rank, even when languishing
with wounds and sickness; and some of them had limbs
amputated in this unworthy situation. But there is,
Sir, no such painful suggestion as that in our resolution:
they had not “been subjected to treatment unexampled
for cruelty in the history of civilized war, and
finding its parallels only in the conduct of savage tribes,&mdash;a
treatment resulting in the death of multitudes by
the slow, but designed, process of starvation”: no such
thing appears in the case; and the judgment of Washington
was applied strictly to the facts before him.</p>

<p>This is not all. Search the history of our country,
and you find that the practice is fixed, while the rule
has received an accuracy of statement from which there
can be no escape. I have before me the words of Chancellor
Kent, in his valuable Commentaries:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Instances of resolutions to retaliate on innocent prisoners
of war occurred in this country during the Revolutionary
War, as well as during the War of 1812; but there was no
instance in which retaliation, beyond the measure of severe
confinement, took place in respect to prisoners of war.”<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

</div>

<p>There you have the authoritative testimony of that
great expounder of our history and of our jurisprudence,
the late Chancellor Kent. I add also the testimony of
another American writer, whom I have quoted more
than once in this Chamber, General Halleck, who, in
his work on International Law, thus expresses himself:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Retaliation should be limited to such punishments as
may be requisite for our own safety and the good of society;
beyond this it cannot be justified. We have no right to
mutilate the ambassador of a barbarous power because his
sovereign has treated our ambassador in that manner, nor
to put prisoners and hostages to death, and to destroy private
property, merely because our enemy has done this to
us; for no individual is justly chargeable with the guilt of a
personal crime for the acts of the community of which he is
a member.”<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

</div>

<p>I said, Sir, the practice proposed was without precedent
in the history of other nations. I believe that I
am right. I am confident that no authentic record can
be shown where such savage treatment has been imitated
in retaliation by a Christian power. One of the
most learned writers on the Law of Nations, Vattel,
dealing with this very subject, aptly puts the following
question:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“By what right will you cause the nose and ears of the
ambassador of a barbarian to be cut off who shall have
treated your ambassador in this manner?”<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

</div>

<p>That question strikes at the heart of this whole subject.
What right have you to adopt any barbarous
conduct because the barbarous enemy with whom you
deal has set the example? This same eminent publicist,
in another place, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Roman Senate held it as a maxim, that war was to
be carried on with arms, and not with poison.… The
Senate, and Tiberius himself, thought it not permissible
to employ poison, even against a perfidious enemy, and as
a kind of retortion or reprisal.”<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>That statement covers the whole case. Why is it
unlawful in retaliation to adopt poison? Because it is
barbarous. And for the same reason it is unlawful for
us to adopt starvation, to adopt all that cruel system of
treatment so emphatically set forth in the preamble to
this resolution. And while, Sir, I concede that by the
Laws of War retaliation is permissible, yet it has its
limits; and those limits, as I venture to say in the resolutions
sent to the Chair as a substitute, are at least
twofold: first, the retaliation must be useful, it must
reasonably promise some practical result; and, in the
second place, it must be in harmony with the usages of
civilized nations. The retaliation now proposed is useless,
for it can have no practical result; and it is not in
harmony with the usages of civilized nations.</p>

<p>I have said that the Laws of War recognize retaliation,
as appears in the recent most formal and explicit declaration
to be found in the very elaborate “Instructions
for the Government of Armies of the United States
in the Field,”<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> prepared since this war began, under the
direction of a learned commission, and by the pen of
one of the ablest and most accomplished publicists of
our age. I refer to Dr. Lieber, for many years professor
in South Carolina College, and now professor in Columbia
College, New York. In these Instructions the general
law of retaliation is affirmed.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Law of War can no more wholly dispense with retaliation
than can the Law of Nations, of which it is a branch.
Yet civilized nations acknowledge retaliation as the sternest
feature of war. A reckless enemy often leaves to his opponent
no other means of securing himself against the repetition
of barbarous outrage.”<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>Such is the general principle, officially declared. And
now, Sir, I shall read the commentary of this same
learned publicist on these very Instructions in a private
letter which I have received from him this morning.
Bear in mind, Sir, that the writer is a student of the
Laws of War, that he vindicates their exercise, and that
in proper cases he asserts the right of retaliation; and
now allow me to present his criticism on the retaliation
proposed.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am unqualifiedly against the retaliation resolutions
concerning prisoners of war. The provision that the Southerners
in our hands shall be watched over by national soldiers
who have been in Southern pens is unworthy of any
great people or high-minded statesman. I am not opposed
to retaliation because it strikes those who are not or may
not be guilty of the outrage we wish to put an end to.
That is the terrible character of almost all retaliation in
war. I abhor this revenge on prisoners of war, because we
would sink thereby to the level of the enemy’s shame and
dishonor. All retaliation has some limit. If we fight with
Indians who slowly roast their prisoners, we cannot roast
in turn the Indians whom we may capture. And what is
more, I defy Congress or Government to make the Northern
people treat captured Southerners as our sons are treated by
them. God be thanked, you could not do it; and if you
could, how it would brutalize our own people! I feel the
cruelty as keenly as any one; I grieve most bitterly that
people whom we and all the world have taken to possess the
common attributes of humanity, and who, after all, are our
kin, have sunk so loathsomely low; I feel the hardship of
seeing no immediate and direct remedy, except conquering
and trampling out the vile Rebellion; but I maintain that
the proposed (yet unfeasible) retaliation is not the remedy.
Indeed, calmly to maintain our ground would do us in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
end far more good. Revenge is passion, and ought never to
enter the sphere of public action. Passion always detracts
from power.</p>

<p>“I believe that the ineffable cruelty practised against our
men has been equalled in the history of our race by the
Spanish treatment of the Indians, and by the Inquisition;
but counter cruelty would not mend matters. Those who
can allow such crimes would not be moved by cruelties inflicted
upon their soldiers in our hands. These cruelties,
therefore, would be simply revenge, not retaliation; for retaliation,
as an element of the Law of War, and of Nations
in general, implies the idea of thereby stopping a certain
evil. But no mortal shall indulge in revenge.</p>

<p>“I am, indeed, against all dainty treatment of the prisoners
in our hands; but, for the love of our country and
the great destiny of our people, do not sink, even in single
cases, to the level of our unhappy, shameless enemy.”</p>

</div>

<p>I have read this letter, and I quote it as authority,
because it is by the very pen which embodied retaliation
in the Instructions to the Armies of the United
States.</p>

<p>There is another authority which I quote. It is
Phillimore, the accomplished publicist, whose elaborate
work on the Law of Nations has a learning second only
to that of Grotius in treating the same subject. Recording
excesses of war by the French, this Englishman
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“At the beginning of the wars of the first French Revolution,
the French general announced his intention of
giving no quarter to English prisoners. The English did
not retaliate, and the Laws of War upon this subject were
soon restored.”<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>
<p>In other words, the Laws of War are essentially
humane, and not to be changed by any spasm of barbarism
in an enemy.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>A debate of several days ensued, in which Mr. Wade and Mr. Howard
argued earnestly for the resolution of the Committee, and they
were sustained by Mr. Gratz Brown, of Missouri, Mr. Howe, of Wisconsin,
Mr. Harlan, of Iowa, Mr. Clark, of New Hampshire, Mr. Wilkinson,
of Minnesota, Mr. Chandler, of Michigan, and Mr. Lane, of
Indiana. On the other side were Mr. Cowan, of Pennsylvania, Mr.
Hendricks, of Indiana, Mr. Henderson, of Missouri, Mr. Foster, of
Connecticut, Mr. Davis, of Kentucky, Mr. Reverdy Johnson, of Maryland,
Mr. Richardson, of Illinois, Mr. McDougall, of California, and
Mr. Doolittle, of Wisconsin. Mr. Chandler especially condemned the
position of Mr. Sumner. Here he said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Sir, the Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. <span class="smcap">Sumner</span>] has brought in a
sublimated specimen of humanitarianism that does not apply to these accursed
Rebels at this time. They do not appreciate that kind of humanitarianism.
I expected those men who desire that the Rebellion should
succeed to oppose retaliation, and to oppose it to the bitter end; but I did
not expect the Senator from Massachusetts to come in here and say that it
was inexpedient to protect our suffering prisoners.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> “I have not said so.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Wilson, of Massachusetts, moved as a substitute for Mr. Sumner’s
amendment a simple resolution requiring the President “to
appoint two commissioners to confer with the Confederate authorities,
with a view of devising some practicable plan for the relief and better
treatment of our prisoners of war.” Mr. Clark, of New Hampshire,
offered still another substitute, to be considered when in order:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That Congress earnestly calls the attention of the President to the condition
and treatment of our prisoners of war in Rebel prisons and camps;
and if, for reasons satisfactory to or controlling the Executive, they cannot
be exchanged, desires that he should employ every means in his power, embracing
retaliation to such a degree as may be proper and effectual, to prevent
the continuance and recurrence of such barbarities, and to compel the
insurgents to observe the laws of civilized warfare.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Wade, who was urging the original resolution, also gave notice
of an amendment, to strike out all after the word “retaliation,” and
insert as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That the executive and military authorities of the United States are
hereby directed to retaliate upon the prisoners of the enemy in such manner
<i>and kind</i> as shall be effective in deterring him from the perpetration in
future of cruel and barbarous treatment of our soldiers.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Wade recognized the change so far as to say, “Now, if a Senator
is for retaliation, if he is for the principle of it, he cannot have it
in a milder form than it is there.” Mr. Morrill proposed to strike out
the words “and kind,” and insert, instead, “in conformity to the Laws
of Nations,” which amendment was accepted by Mr. Wade.</p>

<p>January 28th, in the course of the debate, Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;Listening with interest to this
debate, and noting the various propositions to modify
the original resolution of the Committee, especially
that of the Senator [Mr. <span class="smcap">Wade</span>] who has urged it so
vehemently, and then again the modification even of
this modification, I have been reminded of the story
told by Byron<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> of Mr. Fox, afterwards British minister
at Washington, and now sleeping in our Congressional
burial-ground, who said of himself, after an illness
in Naples, that he was “so changed that his oldest
creditors would hardly know him.” But no illness
could work a greater change than is promised in the
resolution of the Committee. In the form it is about
to assume, its oldest supporter will hardly know it.
The ancient legend of the ship of Theseus is revived.
That famous ship, which bore the Athenian hero on his
adventurous expedition to Crete, was piously preserved
in the arsenal of Athens, where its decaying timbers
were renewed, until, in the lapse of time, every part of
the original ship had disappeared, and nothing but the
name remained. Are we not witnessing a similar process,
to end, I trust, in a similar disappearance?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>
<p>In its original form, the resolution so earnestly maintained
by my friends from Ohio and Michigan called
for retaliation in kind,&mdash;eye for eye, tooth for tooth,
cruelty for cruelty, freezing for freezing, starvation for
starvation, death for death. The President was commanded
to imitate Rebel barbarism in all respects,
point by point. This command I felt it my duty to
resist. I said nothing against retaliation according to
the laws and usages of civilized nations, for that I
know is one of the terrible incidents of war; but I
resisted a principle which civilization disowns. The
resolutions I offered as a substitute were intended as
a sort of “earthwork” in support of this resistance.
Perhaps they have already accomplished their purpose,
inasmuch as Senators have evacuated their original position.</p>

<p>The question is solemn enough, and yet, as I recall
the original resolution, I am reminded of an incident,
more comic than serious, which occurred at Paris,
while occupied by the conquering Prussians, in 1814.
A Prussian soldier was brought before the Governor,
charged with unmercifully beating a Frenchman, at
whose house he was billeted, for not supplying a bottle
of Berlin <i>weissbier</i>, which the Prussian insisted upon
drinking. The Governor spoke of unreasonableness in
the demand, and declared that he should be obliged to
inflict severe punishment, when the Prussian soldier set
up the Law of Retaliation. “I was a little boy,” said
he, “when a French dragoon beat my father because he
was unable to find a bottle of claret in our whole village,
and I then swore, that, if ever I reached France, I
would beat a Frenchman for not getting me a bottle of
<i>weissbier</i>. Am I not right?” This was retaliation in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
kind, and retrospective in operation, like that of the
original resolution.</p>

<p>Much as this resolution is changed, so that it no
longer requires retaliation in kind, I think it might be
changed still further. It is not enough, on such an
occasion, and especially after avowals made in this
Chamber, to say that retaliation shall be according to
the principles of Public Law. Montesquieu, in his
“Spirit of Laws,” exhibits the uncertainty of this language.
These are his words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All nations have a Law of Nations,&mdash;even the Iroquois,
who eat their prisoners. They send and receive ambassadors;
they know the Laws of War and Peace. The evil is,
that their Law of Nations is not founded on true principles.”<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The resolution, therefore, for the sake of certainty,
and to give double assurance that humanity shall not
suffer, ought to be still further amended, by limiting
the retaliation to the usages of civilized society. This
amendment becomes the more needful since Senators
argue that by the principles of public law the intolerable
cruelties of the Rebellion may be retaliated.</p>

<p>I desire to repeat my unalterable conviction that
these cruelties cannot be retaliated in kind. And here
I call attention to the opinions of an illustrious citizen,
only recently removed from the duties of this world. I
refer to the late Edward Everett, who, in a speech at
Faneuil Hall, a few days before his lamented death, thus
testifies in what may be called his dying words:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I believe the best way in which we can retaliate upon
the South for the cruel treatment of our prisoners is for
us to continue to treat their prisoners with entire humanity
and all reasonable kindness,&mdash;and not only so, but to
seize every opportunity like the present to go beyond this.
Indeed, it is no more than our duty to treat the prisoner
well. The Law of Nations requires it. The Government
that refuses or neglects it does not deserve the name of civilized.
Even inability is no justification. If you are yourself
so exhausted that you cannot supply your prisoner with
a sufficient quantity of wholesome food, you are bound, with
or without exchange, to set him free. You have no more
right to starve than to poison him. It will, however, be
borne in mind, that, while the hard fare of our prisoners
is defended by the Southern leaders, on the ground that it
is as good as that of their own soldiers, at the same time
they maintain that their harvests are abundant and their
armies well fed. There is no merit in treating a prisoner
with common humanity; it is simply infamous and wicked
to treat him otherwise.”<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

</div>

<p>You will not fail to observe how positive is his
opinion on the limits of retaliation, and its character
when carried beyond proper limits. And here it is
proper to remark, that Mr. Everett was not only a
patriot, who, in the latter trials of the Republic, devoted
himself ably, purely, and successfully to the vindication
and advancement of the national cause, but he
was a publicist, who had profoundly studied the Law of
Nations. Few in our history have understood it better.
His last labors were devoted to this important subject.
At the time of his death he was preparing a course of
lectures upon it. Therefore, when, in the name of Public
Law, he speaks against any imitation of Rebel barbarism,
it is with the voice of authority.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>
<p>From one eminent publicist I pass to another. On a
former occasion I took the liberty of introducing a familiar
letter from Professor Lieber, once of South Carolina,
now of New York. The Senator from Michigan
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Howard</span>], not content with attempting an answer
to the learned professor, proceeded to language with regard
to him which I am sure his careful judgment cannot
approve. The friend whose letter I read needs no
praise as a practical writer and thinker on questions of
International Law. On account of his acknowledged fitness
as a master of this science, he was selected as commissioner
to prepare instructions for the armies of the
United States, constituting a most important chapter of
the Law of Nations. Those instructions are the evidence
of his ability and judgment. So long as they are
followed by our Government, it will be difficult for the
Senator, learned as he unquestionably is, to impeach
their distinguished author. There is no Senator, not
excepting the Senator from Michigan, who might not
be proud to have such a monument of fame. But he is
no mere theorist. It was on the field of battle, where,
as a youthful soldier, he was left for dead, that he began
a practical acquaintance with those Laws of War
which he has done so much to expound.</p>

<p>And now let me read a commentary on the Law of
Retaliation by this authority. I quote from an article
which has already appeared in the New York “Times.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“No mawkish sentimentality has induced the writer to
express his views. He has had dear friends in those Southern
pens, which have become the very symbols of revolting
barbarity; but he desires, for this very reason, that the subject
be weighed without passion, which never counsels well,&mdash;especially
without the passion of mere vengeance. Let us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
bring down this general call for retaliation to practical and
detailed measures. It is supposed, then, that retaliation is
resolved upon; what next? The order is given to harass,
starve, expose, and torture, say twenty thousand prisoners
in our hands, until their bones pierce the skin, and they die
idiots in their filth. Why should things be demanded which
every one knows the Northern man is incapable of doing?</p>

<p>“If, however, by retaliation he meant that captured Rebels
in our hands should be cut off from the pleasant comforts
of life which Northerners subservient to the South love
to extend to them, then, indeed, we fully agree. This treasonable
over-kindness ought never to have been permitted.
It has had the worst effect on the arrogance of our enemy;
but prohibiting it is not, and cannot be called, retaliation.</p>

<p>“Let us not be driven from the position of manly calmness
and moral dignity; and let us, on the other hand,
be stern, so stern that our severity shall impress the prisoners
that they are such. But let us not follow Rebel examples.
It is too sickening, too vile.”</p>

</div>

<p>Such is the testimony of Francis Lieber, in entire,
but independent, harmony with the testimony of Edward
Everett. As authority, nothing further can be
desired. And yet the question is still debated, and
grave Senators take counsel of their indignation rather
than of the law.</p>

<p>The earnestness which has characterized this discussion
attests the interest of the subject, and the interest
here is only a reflection of that throughout the country.
When you speak of our brave officers and soldiers suffering,
languishing, pining, dying in Rebel prisons, you
touch a chord which vibrates in every patriot bosom.
He must be cold, sluggish, and inhuman,&mdash;so cold
“that nought can warm his blood, Sir, but a fever,”<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>&mdash;who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
is not moved to every possible effort for their
redemption.</p>

<p>I am happy to see that the Secretary of War is not
insensible to this commanding duty. Here is an extract
from a communication which he sent to the House of
Representatives as late as January 21st:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“On the 15th October the subject of exchanges was
placed under the direction of Lieutenant-General Grant,
with full authority to take any steps he might deem proper
to effect the release and exchange of our soldiers, and of
loyal persons, held as prisoners by the Rebel authorities.
He was instructed that it was the desire of the President
that no efforts consistent with national safety and honor
should be spared to effect the prompt release of all soldiers
and loyal persons in captivity to the Rebels as prisoners of
war, or on any other grounds, and the subject was committed
to him with full authority to act in the premises as
he should deem right and proper. Under this authority
the subject of exchanges has from that time continued in
his charge, and such efforts have been made as he deemed
proper to obtain the release of our prisoners.</p>

<p>“An arrangement was made for the supply of our prisoners,&mdash;the
articles to be distributed under the direction of
our own officers, paroled for that purpose; and the corresponding
privilege was extended to the Rebel authorities.
In order to afford every facility for relief, special exchanges
have been offered, whenever desired on behalf of our prisoners.
Such exchanges have in a few instances been permitted
by the Rebel authorities, but in many others they
have been denied.</p>

<p>“A large number of exchanges, including all the sick,
has been effected within a recent period. The Commissary
General of Prisoners has been directed to make a detailed
report of all the exchanges that have been accomplished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
since the general exchange ceased. It will be furnished to
the House of Representatives as soon as completed.</p>

<p>“The last communication of General Grant gives reason
to believe that a full and complete exchange of all prisoners
will speedily be made. It also appears from his statement
that weekly supplies are furnished to our prisoners, and distributed
by officers of our own selection.”<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Let these instructions be followed, and it is difficult
to see what remains to be done. Exchange, retaliation,
and every other agency “right and proper,” are fully
authorized in the discretion of the commanding general.
There is nothing in the arsenal of war he may not employ.
What more is needed? But this brings me
again to the proposition before the Senate.</p>

<p>The Committee, not content with what has been
done,&mdash;distrustful, perhaps, of the commanding general,&mdash;propose
that Congress shall instruct the President
to enter upon a system of retaliation, <i>where we
shall imitate as precisely as possible Rebel barbarism</i>,
and make our prisons the scenes of torments we here
denounce. Why, Sir, to state the case is to answer
it. The Senator from Michigan, who advocates so eloquently
this <i>unprecedented retaliation</i>, attempted a description
of the torments making the Rebel prisons
horrible, but language failed him. After speaking of
their “immeasurable criminality,” and “the horrors of
those scenes,” which he said were “absolutely indescribable,”
beggaring even his affluence of language and
of passion, he proceeded to ask that we should do these
same things,&mdash;that we should take the lives of prisoners,
even by freezing and starvation, or turn them into
living skeletons,&mdash;by Act of Congress.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>
<p>Sir, the Law of Retaliation, which he invokes, has its
limits, and these are found in the laws of civilized society.
Admit the Law of Retaliation; yet you cannot
escape from its circumscription. As well escape from
the planet on which we live. What civilization forbids
cannot be done. Your enemy may be barbarous and
cruel, but you cannot be barbarous and cruel. The rule
is clear and unquestionable. Perhaps the true principle
of law on this precise point was never better
expressed than by one of our masters, William Shakespeare,
natural jurist as well as poet, when he makes
Macbeth exclaim,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“I dare do all that may become a man;</div>
<div class="verse">Who dares do more is none.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">So with us now. We are permitted to do all that may
become men, but nothing more.</p>

<p>Surely nobody will argue that the “barbarities of
Andersonville,” and all those tortures we deplore, can
behoove men. As well undertake, by way of retaliation,
to revive the boot and thumb-screw of the Inquisition,
the fires of Smithfield, “Luke’s iron crown and
Damien’s bed of steel,” or to repeat that execrable
crime pictured by Dante, in one of his most admired
passages, where Ugolino and his children were shut up
in a tower, without food or water, and left to die slowly,
cruelly, wickedly, by starvation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Thou modern Thebes! what though, as Fame hath said,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Count Ugolino did thy forts betray?</div>
<div class="verse">His sons deserved not punishment so dread.”<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Thanks to the immortal poet who has blasted forever
this sickening enormity, and rendered its imitation impossible!
Thanks to that mighty voice which has given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
new sanction to the mandate of Public Law. And yet
in this terrible case there was retaliation, and the famished
victim is revealed as ferociously gnawing the
skull of his tormentor. But this was not on earth.</p>

<p>It is when we consider precisely the conduct of the
Rebels, as represented,&mdash;when we read the stories of
their atrocities,&mdash;when we call to mind the sufferings
of our men in their hands,&mdash;when we look on the pictures
introduced into this discussion, where photographic
art has sought to exhibit the living skeletons,&mdash;when
the whole scene in all its horror is before us, and our
souls are filled with unutterable anguish, that we confess
how difficult, how absolutely impossible, it is for us
to follow this savage example. And just in proportion
as this treatment of our soldiers transcends the usages
of civilized society must the example be rejected. Such
is the law you cannot disobey.</p>

<p>Nor am I to be considered indifferent to the condition
of those unhappy prisoners. I do not yield to the
Committee, or to any Senator, in ardor or anxiety for
their protection. Whatever can be done I am ready to
do. But, as American citizens, they have an interest
that we should do nothing by which our country shall
forfeit the great place belonging to it in the vanguard
of nations. It cannot be best for them that our country
should do an unworthy thing. It cannot be best
for them that the national destiny should be thus darkened.
Duties are in proportion to destinies, and from
the very heights of our example I argue again that we
cannot allow ourselves, under any passing passion or
resentment, to accept a policy which history must condemn.
There is not a patriot soldier who would not
cry out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> “Let me suffer, but save my country!”</p>

<p>Even if you make up your minds to do this thing,
you cannot. The whole idea is impracticable. The
attempt must fail, because human nature is against you.
“<i>Nemo repente turpissimus.</i>” A humane and civilized
people cannot suddenly become inhuman and uncivilized.
Conscience, heart, soul and body, will all rise
against you. From every side will be repeated that
generous cry which comes to us from the darkest day
of French history, when the courageous governor said
to the monarch who ordered the massacre of St. Bartholomew,
“Sire, I have under me good citizens and
brave soldiers, but not a single executioner”; or that
other later cry, when the French Convention, under
the lead of Barère, decreed that all English prisoners
should be shot,&mdash;“We will not shoot them,” said a
stout-hearted sergeant; “if the Convention takes pleasure
in killing prisoners, let members kill them and eat
them, like savages as they are.” But the citizens and
soldiers of the armies of the United States are not less
generous. They, too, would cry out, “Let members of
Congress do this work, if it is to be done; but do not
impose it upon a fellow-man.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. President, with pain I differ from valued friends
whose friendship is among the treasures of my life.
But I cannot help it. I cannot do otherwise. It is
long since I first raised my voice in this Chamber
against the “Barbarism of Slavery,” and I have never
ceased to denounce it in season and out of season. But
the Rebellion is nothing but that very barbarism armed
for battle. Plainly it is our duty to overcome it, not to
imitate it. Here I stand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<div class="medium">

<p>January 31st, on motion of Mr. Sumner, it was still further amended
so as to read, “in conformity with the laws <i>and usages of war among
civilized</i> nations,”&mdash;Yeas 27, Nays 13. Mr. Sumner then withdrew
his substitute, remarking that he did so because the original resolution
had undergone such modification as to be in substantial harmony
with the resolutions introduced by him. After other amendments, the
original resolution was passed by the Senate; but it was never acted
on in the House of Representatives.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This effort against Retaliation attracted attention and sympathy at
the time.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Hon. Israel Washburn, formerly a Representative in Congress from
Maine, being in Washington, wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I shall not see you again before leaving the city, but I will not go without
thanking you from my heart’s heart for the glorious resolutions upon
Retaliation which you offered in the Senate yesterday. Our country must
live in the atmosphere of those resolutions, or bear no life worth having.”</p>

</div>

<p>John B. Kettell wrote from Boston:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have read in the papers of this morning a telegraphic report of the
proceedings of the Senate on the resolution in relation to retaliation upon
Rebel prisoners for cruel treatment to Union prisoners, and especially the
resolutions offered by you as a substitute for the resolution before the Senate.
Although not approving the policy of the Administration, and therefore
conscientiously opposed to most of its measures, allow me to thank you
from the bottom of my heart for the manly tone and lofty Christian sentiment
which pervade the resolutions offered and so ably defended by yourself.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. Daniel W. Alvord wrote from Greenfield, Massachusetts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I wish also to thank you for your resolutions on Retaliation. I am the
more impelled to do this because I think it probable that some of our friends
in the State will remonstrate with you for having offered them. I have
heard retaliation in kind vehemently advocated by good men in Boston.
But it seems to me that it would be an indelible blot upon our fame, if, in a
war with savages, we should imitate their savage cruelties. I know that
retaliation by inflicting death for death may sometimes be necessary in war.
But the torture of prisoners nothing can justify. If they may be tortured by
hunger or cold, so they may, as well, by fire, or by the rack.”</p>

</div>

<p>M. T. Johnstone, of the United States Coast Survey, wrote from
Washington:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A copy of your speech on the treatment of prisoners of war has just
fallen into my hands. I think the country under deep obligations to you for
that speech, and for saving it from either acknowledging or practising the
principle of retaliation.”</p>

<p>The following communication from General Robert Anderson, of the
Army of the United States, who commanded at Fort Sumter when
South Carolina madly fired upon that national stronghold, contains
the testimony of a soldier.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">New York City</span>, January 25, 1865.</p>

unacceptable. I trust, therefore, that you will pardon me for giving vent to
the promptings of my heart, in offering you my thanks for the noble, manly,
and Christian sentiments which characterize your resolutions introduced in
the Senate yesterday, in reference to the subject of Retaliation. No one
would go farther than I would, to put down, with a vigorous and resolute
hand, this most accursed Rebellion. But, in God’s name, Sir, let it be done
in such a manner that those who live after us may be able to say, that,
in all this time of trial, not one act was sanctioned or permitted by our Government
which was not becoming us as a civilized and Christian nation.
And God will bless and prosper us only as we do so act. My earnest prayer
is, that He will endue our rulers with wisdom, and soon give peace and
prosperity and happiness to our bleeding land.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The sentiments you express in your speech are such as become a Christian

me to tender my thanks as an American for his noble resolutions on the

<div class="medium">

<p>John S. Rock, Esq., was a colored lawyer in Boston, who, after
studying medicine, accomplished himself in the law, and visited Europe.
In the hope of advancing his race and of overturning an obnoxious
precedent, he formed the idea of being admitted to the bar of the
Supreme Court of the United States, even during the life of Chief Justice
Taney; but Mr. Sumner, to whom he applied, could not encourage
him, while the author of the Dred Scott decision presided over the
Court. With Mr. Chase as Chief Justice it was otherwise. Before
presenting him, Mr. Sumner communicated with the Chief Justice, who
undertook to sound his brethren and smooth the way. After some
delay he let Mr. Sumner know that the motion might be made. It
seems, that, by usage of the Court, the Chief Justice acted on the
admission of counsellors without consulting the rest of the bench, and
it was understood that the usage would be recognized in this case.</p>

<p>As only a citizen could be a counsellor of the Supreme Court, and,
according to the Dred Scott decision, a colored person was not a citizen,
the admission of Mr. Rock was regarded by the country as tantamount
to a reversal of that decision.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An informal and intimate correspondence between Mr. Sumner and
the Chief Justice belongs to the history of this case.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the receipt of a letter from Mr. Rock, saying, “We now have a
great and good man for our Chief Justice, and with him I think my
color will not be a bar to my admission,” Mr. Sumner wrote to the
Chief Justice, inclosing the letter.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Senate Chamber</span>, 21st December, 1864.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Chase</span>,&mdash;Please read the inclosed letter, and let me know

<p>“Mr. Rock is an estimable colored lawyer, who, as you will see, is cordially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
recommended by Governor Andrew and others in the public service.
He is one of several colored lawyers in Massachusetts, who practise in all
our courts, and are always received with courtesy.</p>

<p>“Before I came into the Senate, now several years ago, I was counsel in
a case before our Massachusetts Supreme Court,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> where one of these colored
lawyers was my associate, and I remember well the very great kindness and
attention with which he was received by Chief Justice Shaw and all the
bench.</p>

<p>“I mention these things that you may see something of Mr. Rock’s title
to admission to the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>

<p>“I know not how far the Dred Scott decision may stand in the way.</p>

<p>“Of course, the admission of a colored lawyer to the bar of the Supreme

<p>The following note, written in pencil, and sent to Mr. Sumner at his

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Supreme Court Room</span>, December 21, 1864.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sumner</span>,&mdash;I will confer with the Judges on Saturday, which is

</div>

<p>Not hearing from the Chief Justice, Mr. Sumner sent the following

<p>Mr. Rock, who was waiting in Boston, appeared February 1st, and
was at once presented by Mr. Sumner. The few formal words which
passed on this occasion are not without interest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As soon as the judges had taken their seats, Mr. Sumner rose, and,
with Mr. Rock standing by his side, said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">May it please the Court</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p class="dropcap">I ask leave to present John S. Rock, Esq., a Counsellor
at Law of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts,

<div class="medium">

<p>The Chief Justice bowed, and said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Let him come forward and take the oath.”</p>

</div>

<p>The oath was then administered by Mr. Middleton, Clerk of the
Court. At the same time, on motion of Mr. Sumner, Francis V. Balch,
Esq., of Boston, his private secretary, was also admitted.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This incident, marking a stage in the battle for Equal Rights, was
extensively noticed at home and abroad. It occurred on the day after
the final passage in the House of Representatives of the Constitutional
Amendment abolishing Slavery, and the correspondent of the <i>Boston
Journal</i> remarked the association of the two events.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Slave Power, which received its constitutional death-blow yesterday
in Congress, writhes this morning on account of the admission of a colored
lawyer, John S. Rock, of Boston, as a member of the bar of the Supreme
Court of the United States.… The rage depicted in the countenances of
some of the old Hunkers present at this invasion of their citadel beggars
description.”</p>

</div>

<p>The correspondent of the <i>New York Tribune</i> announced the event
as “The Dred Scott Decision buried in the Supreme Court,” and then
broke forth enthusiastically:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“O augustly simple funeral <i>cortège</i>! O dead, wrapped in the cerements
that the divine hand of Revolution folds its victims with, augustly

<p>“Through the door that was too narrow to freely let out the bearers that
bore Charles Sumner’s inanimate form from the Senate Chamber, where he
had been stricken down by the assassins of the Slave Power, Charles Sumner
to-day marched back, leading a negro by the hand, and, standing upon
the very spot that had been stained with his blood for demanding freedom
and equality for the blacks in America, demanded of the Supreme Court of
the United States to enroll among its members an African lawyer, and to
license him to practise at its bar. The black man was admitted.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then mentioning the motion of Mr. Sumner, the same correspondent
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The grave to bury the Dred Scott decision was in that one sentence dug,
and it yawned there, wide open, under the very eyes of some of the judges
who had participated in the juridical crime against Democracy and Humanity.
The assenting nod of the great head of the Chief Justice tumbled in
the corse and filled up the pit, and the black counsellor of the Supreme
Court got on to it and stamped it down, and smoothed the earth for his walk
to the rolls of the Court.</p>

<p>“… A few lawyers of the old <i>régime</i> looked on, stunned somewhat,
but rapidly growing in wisdom, and mixing deference to destiny with their
instinctive reluctance to this revolutionary intrusion.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Cobden, writing from England, also associated this event with
the Constitutional Amendment. In a letter shortly before his much
lamented death, he said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I feel it a pleasant duty to give you my best congratulations on the recent
proceedings within and without your Halls of Congress. The vote on
the Amendment of the Constitution was a memorable and glorious event in
your history. Another incident&mdash;that of your introduction of a colored
man to the Supreme Court&mdash;was hardly less interesting. In all these proceedings
at Washington <i>you</i> ought to be allowed to indulge the feelings of a
triumphant general. You served as a volunteer in the forlorn hope, when
the battle of Emancipation seemed a hopeless struggle. <i>Your</i> position
within the Halls of Congress was very different from that of the agitators
out of doors, meritorious as were their labors. I have served in both capacities,
and know the difference between addressing an audience of partisans
at a public meeting and a hostile parliamentary assembly.…
I heartily congratulate you.”</p>

</div>

<p>Doubtless the admission of a colored lawyer to the Supreme Court
helped prepare the way for admission of his race to the rights of citizenship,
and especially the right to vote.</p>

of Representatives according to voters, which would make it
for the interest of a State to extend the franchise. Without one of

</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>April 25, 1864, Mr. Sumner asked, and by unanimous consent obtained,
leave to bring in the following joint resolution, which was read
twice, and referred to the Committee on Military Affairs.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A Joint Resolution to facilitate commercial, postal, and military communication
among the several States.</p>

<p>“Whereas the Constitution of the United States confers upon Congress,
in express terms, the power to regulate commerce among the several States,
to establish post-roads, and to raise and support armies: Therefore,</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
of America in Congress assembled</i>, That every railroad company in the
United States, whose road is operated by steam, its successors and assigns,
be, and is hereby, authorized to carry upon and over its road, connections,
boats, bridges, and ferries, all freight, property, mails, passengers, troops,
and Government supplies, on their way from any State to any other State,
and to receive compensation therefor.”</p>

</div>

<p>May 12th, Mr. Wilson, of Massachusetts, from the Committee,
reported it without amendment.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the House of Representatives had under consideration
a bill to declare certain roads military roads and post-roads, and to
regulate commerce, which was much debated, when, on motion of Mr.
Wilson, of Iowa, Mr. Sumner’s joint resolution, without the preamble,
and with the title, “A Bill to regulate commerce among the several
States,” was adopted as a substitute, and the bill thus amended passed
the House,&mdash;Yeas 63, Nays 58.</p>

<p>In the Senate the bill was elaborately discussed, especially by Mr.
Reverdy Johnson, of Maryland; but its friends were never able to press
it to a vote, and it expired with the session. In one of these efforts
Mr. Sumner said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> “There are two ways of killing a measure: one is
by voting it down; the other is by postponing it until you lose an
opportunity of voting on it; and the latter is the policy of certain
Senators now.”</p>

<p>March 3, 1865, failing to obtain a vote on the bill, Mr. Sumner
moved it as an amendment to the Post-Route Bill, but without success.</p>

<p>February 14th, while the bill was under consideration, Mr. Sumner
spoke.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;The question before us concerns
the public convenience to a remarkable
degree. But it concerns also the unity of this Republic.
Look at it in its simplest form, and you will confess
its importance. Look at it in its political aspect,
and you will recognize how vital it is to the integrity
of the Union itself. On one side we encounter a formidable
Usurpation with all the pretensions of State
Rights, hardly less flagrant and pernicious than those
which ripened in bloody rebellion. On the other side
are the simple and legitimate claims of the Union
under the Constitution of the United States.</p>

<p>Thus stands the question at the outset: public convenience
and the Union itself in its beneficent powers
on the one side; public inconvenience and all the
discord of intolerable State pretensions on the other
side.</p>

<p>The proposition on its face is applicable to all the
States throughout the Union, and in its vital principle
concerns every lover of his country. But it cannot be
disguised that the interest it has excited in the other
House, and also in the Senate, must be referred to its
bearing on the railroads of New Jersey. Out of this
circumstance springs the ardor of opposition,&mdash;perhaps,
also, something of the ardor of support. Therefore
pardon me, if I glance one moment at the geographical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
position of this State, and its Railroad Usurpation
in the name of State Rights.</p>

<p>Look on the map, or, better still, consult your own
personal experience in the journey from Washington to
New York, and you will find that New Jersey lies on
the great line of travel between the two capitals of the
country, political and commercial. There it is, directly
in the path. It cannot be avoided, except by circuitous
journey. On this single line commerce, passengers,
mails, troops, all must move. In the chain of communication
by which capital is bound to capital,&mdash;nay,
more, by which the Union itself is bound together,&mdash;there
is no single link of equal importance. Strike
it out, and where are you? Your capitals will be separated,
and the Union itself loosened. But the evil sure
to follow, if this link were struck out, must follow also
in proportionate extent from every interference with
that perfect freedom of transit through New Jersey
which I now ask in behalf of commerce, passengers,
mails, and troops.</p>

<p>Such is the geographical position of New Jersey.
And on this highway pernicious pretensions are set
up which can be overthrown only by the power of
Congress. The case is plain.</p>

<p>New Jersey, in the exercise of pretended State rights,
has undertaken to invest the Delaware and Raritan Canal
and the Camden and Amboy Railroad and Transportation
Companies with unprecedented prerogatives.
These are the words of the Legislature:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> “It shall not
be lawful, at any time during the said railroad charter,
to construct any other railroad or railroads in this State,
without the consent of the said companies, which shall
be intended or used for the transportation of passengers
or merchandise <i>between the cities of New York and Philadelphia</i>,
or to compete in business with the railroad
authorized by the Act to which this supplement is
relative.”<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Here, in barefaced terms, is the grant of monopoly
in all railroad transportation, whether of commerce,
passengers, mails, or troops, between <i>New York</i>,
a city <i>outside</i> of New Jersey, and <i>Philadelphia</i>, another
city <i>outside</i> of New Jersey. Or, looking at this grant
of monopoly again, we find, that, <i>while leaving the local
transportation of New Jersey untouched</i>, it undertakes to
regulate and appropriate the transportation between two
great cities outside of New Jersey, constituting, from
geographical position, the gates through which the whole
immense movement, north and south, must pass.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If this monopoly is offensive on its face, it becomes
still more offensive, when we consider the motive in
which it had its origin. By confession of its supporters,
it was granted in order to raise a revenue for
the State out of men and business not of the State. It
was an ingenious device to tax commerce, passengers,
mails, and troops in transit across New Jersey, from
State to State. I quote a confession from the Legislative
Journal of New Jersey, as long ago as 1841, in a
document by the executive committee of the coalesced
railroads, represented by the Camden and Amboy Company.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It seems plain, from the acts incorporating these companies,
and the testimony of those best conversant with the
history of their incorporations, that it was the policy of the
State, <i>taking advantage of the geographical position of New
Jersey</i>, between the two largest States and cities of the
Union, <i>to create a revenue by imposing a tax or transit duty
upon every person who should pass on the railroad across the
State</i> between these cities from the Delaware River to the
Raritan Bay; but that it was not their design to impose
any tax upon citizens of their own State for travelling between
intermediate places.… Here, again, the policy
and intention of the State is most clearly indicated in exempting
her own citizens from the operation of this system
of taxation.”<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

</div>

<p>I quote the words of another functionary, equally
frank, belonging to the same railroad connection.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Company believe that a careful consideration of the
whole matter, as well from the provisions of the charter as
from a recurrence to the period when it was granted, will
produce the conviction that <i>the transit duty was intended to
be levied only on citizens of other States passing through New
Jersey</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The spirit in which this tax has been laid appears
from another incident, not without interest to the Senators
from New York. The Erie Railroad, so important
to transportation in the great State which they represent,
has been compelled, in addition to the usual tax
on that part of the road in New Jersey, to pay an extra
tax in the shape of “a transit duty of three cents on
every passenger and two cents on every ton of goods,
wares, and merchandise, <i>except passengers and freight
transported exclusively within</i> this State.” This imposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
was as late as 1862, and is part of that same system
which constitutes the Railroad Usurpation of New
Jersey to this day.</p>

<p>This Usurpation becomes still more apparent in the
conduct adopted toward another railroad in New Jersey.
It appears that a succession of railroads has been
constructed, under charters of this State, from Raritan
Bay, opposite New York, to Camden, opposite Philadelphia,
constituting a continuous line, suitable for transportation,
across New Jersey and between the two great
cities of New York and Philadelphia. The continuous
line is known as the Raritan and Delaware Bay Railroad.
On the breaking out of the Rebellion, when
Washington was menaced by a wicked enemy, and the
patriots of the land were aroused to sudden effort, the
Quartermaster General of the United States directed
the transportation of troops, horses, baggage, and munitions
of war from New York to Philadelphia over this
line. The other railroad, claiming a monopoly, filed a
bill in equity, praying that the Raritan and Delaware
Bay Railroad “be decreed to desist and refrain” from
such transportation, and also praying “that <i>an account</i>
may be taken to ascertain the amount of damages.”
The counsel of the monopoly openly insisted that by
this transportation the State was “robbed of her ten
cents a passenger,” and then cried out: “I say it is no
defence whatever, if they have succeeded in obtaining
an order of the Secretary of War, <i>when we call upon
them to give us the money they made by it</i>; and that is
one of our calls. They have no right to get an order to
deprive the State of New Jersey of the right of transit
duty, <i>which is her adopted policy</i>.” Such was the argument
of Mr. Stockton, counsel for the monopoly, November<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
12, 1863. The <i>transit duty</i> is vindicated as the
<i>adopted policy</i> of New Jersey.</p>

<p>Nor is it modern in time. It may be traced to the
beginning of the National Government, under the
administration of Washington, when it awakened the
indignant comment of Timothy Pickering, Postmaster
General. This patriot citizen, in a communication to
the House of Representatives, under date of February
9, 1793, and entitled “Tax on Mail Stages in New Jersey,”
says, “The avowed design is to increase the revenues
of that State,” precisely as now; and he adds,
what may be repeated: “And thus the citizens of the
United States have to purchase permission to travel
on the highways of New Jersey.” Then, calling the
tax “an annual tribute,” which the United States are
to pay, he says: “And from the example of New Jersey
they may erelong become tributary to all the
States from Virginia to New Hampshire, inclusively;
for so far the mail is carried in stage-wagons.”<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> But
our “stage-wagons” are on railroads now.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such, Sir, are the pretensions of New Jersey to interfere
with commerce, passengers, mails, and troops <i>from
other States</i>, on the way, it may be, to the National
Capital, even with necessary succors at a moment of
national peril. Such pretensions, persistently maintained
and vindicated, constitute a Usurpation, not only
hostile to the public interests, but menacing to the
Union itself. Here is no question of local taxation or
local immunity under State laws, but an open assumption
by a State to tax the commerce of the United
States on the way from State to State.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>
<p>From the nature of the case, and according to every
rule of reason, there ought to be a remedy for such a
grievance. No usurping monopoly should be allowed
to establish itself in any State across the national highway,
and, like a baron of the Middle Ages perched in
his rocky fastness, levy toll and tribute from the wayfarers
of business, pleasure, or duty. The Usurpation
should be overthrown. The nuisance should be abated.
And, happily, the powers are ample under the National
Constitution. Following unquestionable principles and
authentic precedents, the Committee propose a remedy
which I proceed to discuss.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The measure under consideration was originally introduced
by me into the Senate. It was afterward
adopted and passed by the other House as the substitute
for a kindred bill pending there. Beyond the
general interest which I take in the public business,
this is my special reason for entering into this discussion.</p>

<p>The bill is arraigned as unconstitutional. But this
objection is a commonplace of opposition. When all
other reasons fail, then is the Constitution invoked.
Such an attempt, on such an occasion, attests the weakness
of the cause. It is little better than the assertion
of an <i>alias</i> in a criminal case.</p>

<p>The entire and unimpeachable constitutionality of
the present measure is apparent in certain familiar precepts
of the Constitution, brought to view in the title
and preamble of the measure as introduced by me, but
omitted in the bill now before us. The title, as introduced
by me, was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> “A joint resolution to facilitate commercial,
postal, and military communication among the
several States.” This opens the whole constitutional
question. Then came the preamble:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Whereas the Constitution of the United States confers
upon Congress, in express terms, the power to regulate commerce
among the several States, to establish post-roads, and
to raise and support armies: Therefore, <i>Resolved</i>,” &amp;c.</p>

</div>

<p>In these few words three sources of power are clearly
indicated, either of which is ample; but the three together
constitute an overrunning fountain.</p>

<p><i>First.</i> There is the power “to regulate commerce
among the several States.” Look at the Constitution
and you find these identical words. From the great
sensitiveness of States, this power is always exercised
by Congress with peculiar caution; but it still lives to
be employed by an enfranchised Government.</p>

<p>Asserting this power, I follow not only the text of
the Constitution, but also authoritative decisions of the
Supreme Court. Perhaps there is no question in our
constitutional history more clearly interpreted by our
greatest authority, Chief Justice Marshall. In the well-known
case where the State of New York undertook to
grant an exclusive right to navigate the waters of New
York by vessels propelled by steam, the illustrious
Chief Justice, speaking for the Court, declared the
restriction illegal, because it interfered with commerce
between the States, precisely as is now done by New
Jersey. In his opinion commerce was something more
than traffic or the transportation of property. It was
also “the commercial intercourse between nations and
parts of nations in all its branches”; and it embraced,
by necessary inference, <i>all inter-State communications</i>,
and the whole subject of intercourse between the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
of the several States. It was declared that the
power of Congress over the subject was not limited
by State lines, but was coëxtensive with commerce itself,
according to the enlarged signification of the term.
Here are the words of Chief Justice Marshall:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But in regulating commerce with foreign nations, the
power of Congress does not stop at the jurisdictional lines
of the several States. It would be a very useless power, if
it could not pass those lines.… Every district has a right
to participate in it. The deep streams which penetrate
our country in every direction pass through the interior of
almost every State in the Union, and furnish the means of
exercising this right. <i>If Congress has the power to regulate
it, that power must be exercised whenever the subject exists.</i> If
it exists within the States, if a foreign voyage may commence
or terminate at a port within a State, then the power
of Congress may be exercised within a State.”<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This important decision was before railroads. It
grew out of an attempt to appropriate certain navigable
thoroughfares of the Union. But it is equally
applicable to those other thoroughfares of the Union
where the railroad is the substitute for water. According
to the genius of jurisprudence, a rule once established
governs all cases within the original reason on
which it was founded. Therefore I conclude that the
power of Congress over internal commerce by railroad
is identical with that over internal commerce by water.
But this decision does not stand alone.</p>

<p>Mr. Justice Story, a member of the Supreme Court
at that time, in a later decision explained the extent of
the power.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It does not stop at the mere boundary-line of a State;
nor is it confined to acts done on the water, or in the necessary
course of the navigation thereof. <i>It extends to such acts
done on land which interfere with, obstruct, or prevent the due
exercise of the power to regulate commerce</i> and navigation with
foreign nations and <i>among the States</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

</div>

<p>From various cases illustrating this power I call
attention to those known as the <i>Passenger Cases</i>, where
the Supreme Court declared that the statutes of New
York and Massachusetts, imposing taxes upon alien passengers
arriving at the ports of those States, were in
derogation of the Constitution. On this occasion Mr.
Justice McLean said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Shall passengers, admitted by Act of Congress without a
tax, be taxed by a State? The supposition of such a power
in a State is utterly inconsistent with a commercial power,
either paramount or exclusive, in Congress.”<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Justice Grier said, with great point:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To what purpose commit to Congress the power of regulating
our intercourse with foreign nations and among the
States, <i>if these regulations may be changed at the discretion of
each State</i>?… It is, therefore, not left to the discretion
of each State in the Union either to refuse a right of
passage to persons or property through her territory, or to
exact a duty for permission to exercise it.”<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

</div>

<p>But this is the very thing now done by New Jersey,
which “exacts a duty” from passengers across the
State.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>I call attention also to the case of the Wheeling
Bridge, where Congress, under peculiar circumstances,
exercised this identical power. In this case the State
of Pennsylvania denied the power of Virginia to authorize
a bridge across the Ohio River obstructing navigation;
but, under the pressure of public demand, and in
the exercise of the very powers now invoked, Congress
declared the Wheeling Bridge a lawful structure, anything
in any State law to the contrary notwithstanding.
The Supreme Court, after the passage of this Act,
denied a motion to punish the owners of the bridge for
contempt in rebuilding it, and affirmed that the Act
declaring the Wheeling Bridge a lawful structure was
within the legitimate exercise by Congress of its constitutional
power to regulate commerce.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> This very
power is here invoked in a case more important and
far more urgent than that of the Wheeling Bridge.</p>

<p>There is also another case. I refer to the Steubenville
Bridge and Holliday’s Cove Railroad across the
Ohio, in what is called the Panhandle of Virginia.
This bridge was first attempted under a charter granted
by Ohio; but Congress at last interfered, and enacted,&mdash;</p>

<p>Such are precedents of courts and of statutes, showing
how completely this power belongs to Congress in
the regulation of internal commerce. The authorities
are plain and explicit. They cannot be denied. They
cannot be explained away. It would be superfluous to
dwell on them. There they stand like so many granite
columns, fit supports of that internal commerce, in itself
a chief support of the Union.</p>

<p><i>Secondly.</i> There is also the power “to establish post-roads,”
which is equally explicit. Here, too, the words
are plain, and they have received authoritative exposition.
It is with reference to these words that Mr. Justice
Story remarks that “constitutions of government
do not turn upon ingenious subtleties, but are adapted
to the business and exigencies of human society; and
the powers given are understood in a large sense, in
order to secure the public interests. Common sense
becomes the guide, and prevents men from dealing with
mere logical abstractions.”<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> The same learned authority,
in considering the text of the Constitution, seems
to have anticipated the very question before us. Here
is a passage which may fitly close the argument on
this head:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Let a case be taken <i>when State policy</i>”&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">as, for instance, in New Jersey at this time,&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“or State hostility shall lead the Legislature to close up or
discontinue a road, the nearest and the best between two
great States, rivals, perhaps, for the trade and intercourse of
a third State; shall it be said that Congress has no right
to make or repair a road for keeping open for the mail the
best means of communication between those States? May
the National Government be compelled to take the most
inconvenient and indirect routes for the mail? <i>In other
words, have the States a power to say how and upon what
roads the mails shall and shall not travel?</i> If so, then, in
relation to post-roads, the States, and not the Union, are
supreme.”<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

</div>

<p><i>Thirdly.</i> Then comes the power “to raise and support
armies,”&mdash;an unquestionable power lodged in
Congress. But this grant carries with it, of course,
all incidental powers necessary to the execution of the
principal power. It would be absurd to suppose that
Congress was empowered to raise an army, but could
not authorize the agencies required for its transportation
from place to place. Congress has not been guilty
of any such absurdity of abnegation. Already by formal
Act it has proceeded “to authorize the President of
the United States in certain cases to take possession of
railroad and telegraph lines.” By this Act the President
is empowered “to take possession of any or all the
railroad lines in the United States, their rolling stock,
their offices, shops, buildings, and all their appendages
and appurtenances,” and it is declared that any such
railroad “shall be considered as a post-road and a part
of the military establishment of the United States.”<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
Here is the exercise of a broader power than any
now proposed. The less must be contained in the
greater.</p>

<p>Such are the three sources of power in the Constitution,
each and all applicable to the present case. Each
is indisputable. Therefore the conclusion, sustained by
each, is threefold indisputable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>So plain is this power, that it has been admitted by
New Jersey in a legislative act, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That, when any other rail road or roads for the transportation
of passengers and property between New York
and Philadelphia across this State shall be constructed and
used for that purpose, under or by virtue of <i>any law of
this State or the United States authorizing or recognizing
said road</i>, that then and in that case the said dividends
shall be no longer payable to the State, and the said stock
shall be re-transferred to the Company by the Treasurer
of this State.”<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus, in formal words, has New Jersey actually anticipated
the very measure under consideration. All
that is now proposed, so far as concerns New Jersey, is
simply to recognize other railroads for the transportation
of passengers and property between New York and
Philadelphia across this State.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such is the argument in brief for the constitutionality
of the present bill, whether regarded as a general
measure applicable to all railroads, or only applicable
to the railroads of New Jersey. The case is so plain
and absolutely unassailable that I should leave it on
this simple exhibition, if the Senator from Maryland
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Reverdy Johnson</span>], who always brings to these
questions the authority of professional reputation, had
not most zealously argued the other way. According
to him the bill is unconstitutional. Let me say, however,
that the conclusion of the learned Senator is only
slightly sustained by the reasons he assigns. Indeed,
his whole elaborate argument, if brought to the touchstone,
is found inconclusive and unsatisfactory.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>
<p>The Senator opened with the proposition, that the
internal commerce of a State is within the exclusive
jurisdiction of the State, and from this he argued that
the present bill is unconstitutional. But the Senator
will allow me to say that his proposition is not sufficiently
broad for his conclusion. The present bill does
not touch the internal commerce of a State, except so
far as it is a link in the chain of “commerce among
States,” committed by the Constitution to the jurisdiction
of Congress. This distinction must be made; for
it is essential to a right understanding of the case.</p>

<p>From this inapplicable proposition the Senator passed
to another equally inapplicable. He asserted that the
jurisdiction of a State over all territory within its limits
was exclusive, so that the United States cannot
obtain jurisdiction over any portion thereof, except by
assent of the State; and from this again he argued the
unconstitutionality of the present bill. But this very
illustration seems to have been anticipated by Mr.
Justice Story in his excellent Commentaries, where he
shows conclusively, first, that it is inapplicable, and,
secondly, that, if it were applicable, it would be favorable
to the power. Here are his words:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The clause respecting cessions of territory for the seat
of Government, and for forts, arsenals, dock-yards, &amp;c., has
nothing to do with the point. <i>But if it had, it is favorable
to the power.…</i> But surely it will not be pretended
that Congress could not erect a fort or magazine in a place
within a State, unless the State should cede the territory.
The only effect would be that the jurisdiction in such a
case would not be exclusive. Suppose a State should prohibit
a sale of any of the lands within its boundaries by its
own citizens, for any public purposes indispensable for the
Union, either military or civil; would not Congress possess
a constitutional right to demand and appropriate land
within the State for such purposes, making a just compensation?
<i>Exclusive jurisdiction over a road is one thing;
the right to make it is quite another.</i> A turnpike company
may be authorized to make a road, and yet may have no
jurisdiction, or at least no exclusive jurisdiction, over it.”<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Had the distinguished Commentator anticipated the
argument of the Senator, he could not have answered it
more completely.</p>

<p>Passing from these constitutional generalities, the
Senator came at once to an assumption, which, if sustained,
would limit essentially the national power with
regard to post-roads. According to him, the words
of the Constitution authorizing Congress “to establish
post-roads” mean only that it shall “designate roads
already existing”; and in support of this assumption
he relied upon the message of Mr. Monroe, in 1822, on
the Cumberland Road. The learned Senator adds, that
this is “the received opinion, uniformly acted upon,
and since recognized as the correct opinion by the
judiciary.” Of course his testimony on this head is
important; but it is overruled at once by the authority
I have already cited, which says that “the power
to establish post-offices and post-roads has never been
understood to include no more than the power to <i>point
out</i> and <i>designate</i> post-offices and post-roads.”<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> In the
face of Mr. Justice Story’s dissent, expressed in his authoritative
Commentaries, it is impossible to say that
it is “the received opinion,” as asserted by the Senator.
But the much quoted Commentator insists that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> “the
Constitution itself uniformly uses the word ‘established’
in the general sense, and never in this peculiar
and narrow sense,” and, after enumerating various
places where it occurs, says, “It is plain that to construe
the word in any of these cases as equivalent to
<i>designate</i> or <i>point out</i> would be absolutely absurd.
The clear import of the word is to create, and form,
and fix in a settled manner.… To establish post-offices
and post-roads is to frame and pass laws to
erect, make, form, regulate, and preserve them. Whatever
is necessary, whatever is appropriate to this purpose,
is within the power.”<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> I might quote other
words from the same authority; but this is enough to
vindicate the power the Senator has denied.</p>

<p>Here it is my duty to remind the Senate that the
argument of the Senator on this head is not only false
in assumption, but that the assumption, even if correct,
is entirely inapplicable. The bill before the Senate
does not undertake to create, but simply to <i>designate</i>
or <i>point out</i>, certain roads. Therefore it does not fall
under the objection the Senator makes. Even by his
own admission it is constitutional.</p>

<p>But, not content with an erroneous assumption concerning
post-roads, which, even if correct, is entirely
inapplicable, the Senator makes another assumption
concerning another clause of the Constitution, equally
erroneous and inapplicable. He argues that the railroad
charters in New Jersey were grants in the nature
of a contract, and were protected by “the constitutional
inhibition upon the States interfering with contracts”;
and here he refers to several decisions of the Supreme
Court of the United States. I do not trouble you with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
the decisions. It is enough, if I call attention to the
precise text of the Constitution, which is, “<i>No State</i>
shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts.”</p>

<p>Look at these words, and it appears, in the first place,
that this inhibition is addressed to the States, and not
to Congress, whose powers are not touched by it. Look
still further at the railroad charters, and, even admitting
that they were grants in the nature of contract,
you cannot deny that the contract must be interpreted
with reference to the Constitution of the United States.
Learned judges have held that the law of the place
where a contract is made not only regulates and governs
it, <i>but constitutes part of the contract itself</i>. But if
the law constitutes part of the contract, still more must
the Constitution. Apply this principle and the case is
clear. Every railroad charter has been framed subject
to the exercise of the acknowledged powers of Congress,
all of which are implied in the grant as essential conditions,
not less than if set forth expressly. The Supreme
Court has decided that all contracts are made subject
to the right of <i>eminent domain</i>, so that they cannot be
considered as violated by the exercise of this right.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
But the powers of Congress, invoked to regulate commerce
among the several States, to establish post-roads,
and to raise and equip armies, are in the nature of <i>eminent
domain</i>, to which all local charters are subject.
Therefore, I repeat, nothing is proposed “impairing the
obligation of contracts,” even if that well-known inhibition
were applicable to Congress.</p>

<p>From these details of criticism the Senator jumped
to a broader proposition. He asserted that the pending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
measure destroyed what he called the sovereignty
of the States, and he even went so far as to say that
it was the same as if you said that all State legislation
is null and void. These, Sir, were his exact
words. How the Senator, even in any ardor of advocacy,
could venture on such assertion, it is difficult to
comprehend. Here is a measure, founded, as I have
already demonstrated, on three different texts of the
Constitution, upheld by three unassailable supports,
and also in essential harmony with the Union itself;
and yet we are told that it destroys the sovereignty
of the States. Such an assumption seems uttered in
the very wantonness of unhesitating championship. If
anything but a phrase, it must be condemned, not only
as without foundation, but as hostile to the best interests
of the country.</p>

<p>Sir, the pending measure is in no respect destructive
of any rights of the States; nor does it in any
sense say that all State legislation is null and void.
On the contrary, it simply asserts a plain and unquestionable
power under the National Constitution. If in
any way it seems to touch what is invoked as State
sovereignty, or to set aside any State legislation, it is
only in pursuance of the Constitution. It is simply
because the Constitution, and the laws made in pursuance
thereof, are <i>the supreme law of the land</i>.</p>

<p>The assumptions of the Senator bring me back to the
vital principle with which I began. After exhibiting
the public convenience involved in the present question,
I said that it concerned still more the unity of the
Republic. It is, in short, that identical question which
has so often entered this Chamber, and is now convulsing
the land with bloody war. It is the question of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
the Union itself. In his ardor for that vampire monopoly,
which, brooding over New Jersey, sucks the life-blood
of the whole country, the Senator from Maryland
sets up most dangerous pretensions in the name of
State Rights. Sir, the Senator flings into one scale the
pretensions of State Rights: into the other scale I fling
the Union itself.</p>

<p>Sir, the Senator from Maryland is a practised lawyer,
and he cannot have forgotten that Nathan Dane, whose
name is an authority in our courts, tells us plainly
that the terms “sovereign States,” “State sovereignty,”
“State rights,” and “rights of States” are “not constitutional
expressions.”<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Others of equal weight in the
early history of the country have said the same thing.
Mr. Madison, in the Convention which framed the Constitution,
said: “Some contend that States are <i>sovereign</i>,
when, in fact, they are only political societies. The
States never possessed the essential rights of sovereignty.
These were always vested in Congress.”<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Elbridge
Gerry, of Massachusetts, in the same Convention,
said: “It appears to me that the States never
were independent. They had only corporate rights.”<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
Gouverneur Morris, of Pennsylvania, with the same
distinct language he used in denouncing Slavery, said
of the States: “They were originally nothing more
than colonial corporations.”<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Both Patrick Henry and
George Mason, in the Virginia Convention, opposed
the Constitution on the very ground that it superseded
State rights. But perhaps the true intention
of the authors of the Constitution may be best found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
in the letter of General Washington, as President of the
Convention, transmitting it to Congress. Here are his
words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is obviously impracticable, <i>in the Federal Government
of these States, to secure all rights of independent sovereignty
to each</i>, and yet provide for the interest and safety of all.
Individuals entering into society must give up a share of
liberty to preserve the rest.… In all our deliberations
on this subject we kept steadily in our view that which
appeared to us the greatest interest of every true American,
<i>the consolidation of our Union</i>, in which is involved our prosperity,
felicity, safety, perhaps our national existence.”<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

</div>

<p>I am content, when I find myself with the support
of this great name.</p>

<p>By the adoption of the Constitution the people of
the United States constituted themselves <i>a Nation</i>, one
and indivisible, with all the unity and power of a
nation. They were no longer a confederation, subject
to the disturbing pretensions, prejudices, and whims
of component parts; but they became a body politic,
where every part was subordinate to the Constitution,
as every part of the natural body is subordinate to
the principle of life. The sovereignty of the United
States, where all are but parts of one vivifying whole,
was the controlling unit. The powers then and there
conferred upon the nation were supreme. And those
very powers I now invoke, in the name of the Union,
and to the end that pretensions in the name of State
Rights may be overthrown.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have thus presented a picture of these intolerable
pretensions. But they must be examined more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
minutely. They may be seen, <i>first</i>, in their character
as a monopoly, and, <i>secondly</i>, in their character as a
Usurpation under the Constitution of the United States.
I need not say that in each they are equally indefensible.</p>

<p>If you go back to the earliest days of English history,
you find that monopolies have from the beginning
been odious, as contrary to the ancient and fundamental
laws of the realm. A writer who is often quoted
in the courts says: “All grants of this kind relating
to any known trade are made void by the Common
Law, as being against the freedom of trade, and discouraging
labor and industry, and restraining persons
from getting an honest livelihood by a lawful employment,
and putting it in the power of particular persons
to set what prices they please on a commodity.”<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
But, without claiming that the present monopoly is
void at Common Law, it is enough to show its inconsistency
with the Constitution. Here I borrow Mr.
Webster’s language in his famous argument against
the monopoly of steam navigation granted by the
State of New York:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Now I think it very reasonable to say that <i>the Constitution
never intended to leave with the States the power of granting</i>
monopolies either of trade or of navigation,&mdash;and therefore,
that, as to this, the commercial power is exclusive in
Congress.”<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then again he says:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I insist that the nature of the case and of the power did
imperiously require that such important authority as that
of granting monopolies of trade and navigation <i>should not be
considered as still retained by the States</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And, yet again, he adduces an authority which ought
to be conclusive on the present occasion: it is that of
New Jersey, on the formation of the Constitution:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The New Jersey resolutions complain that the regulation
of trade was in the power of the several States, within
their separate jurisdiction, to such a degree as to involve
many difficulties and embarrassments; and they express an
earnest opinion that <i>the sole and exclusive power of regulating
trade with foreign states ought to be in Congress</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">But the power of regulating trade “among the States”
stands on the same reason, and also on the same text of
the Constitution.</p>

<p>And yet, in face of these principles, we have a gigantic
monopoly organized by New Jersey, composed of
several confederate corporations, whose capital massed
together is said to reach upwards of $27,537,977,&mdash;a
capital not much inferior to that of the United States
Bank, which once seemed to hold “divided empire”
with the National Government itself. And this transcendent
monopoly, thus vast in resources, undertakes
to levy a toll on the commerce, the passengers, the
mails, and the troops of the Union in transit between
two great cities, both outside New Jersey. In attitude
and pretension the grasping monopoly is not unlike
Apollyon, in Bunyan’s “Pilgrim’s Progress,” whose
usurpation is thus described:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But now in this Valley of Humiliation poor Christian
was hard put to it; for he had gone but a little way before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
he espied a foul fiend coming over the field to meet him:
his name is Apollyon. Then did Christian begin to be
afraid, and to cast in his mind whether to go back or to
stand his ground.…</p>

<p>“Now the monster was hideous to behold: he was
clothed with scales like a fish, and they are his pride; he
had wings like a dragon, feet like a bear, and out of his
belly came fire and smoke, and his mouth was as the mouth
of a lion. When he was come up to Christian, he beheld
him with a disdainful countenance, and thus began to question
with him.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Apollyon.</span> Whence come you, and whither are you
bound?</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Christian.</span> I am come from the City of Destruction,
which is the place of all evil, and am going to the City of
Zion.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Apollyon.</span> By this I perceive thou art one of my subjects;
for all that country is mine, and I am the prince and
god of it.”</p>

</div>

<p>New Jersey is the Valley of Humiliation through
which all travellers north and south from the city of
New York to the city of Washington must pass; and
the monopoly, like Apollyon, claims them all as “subjects,”
saying, “For all that country is mine, and I am
the prince and god of it.”</p>

<p>The enormity of the Usurpation is seen in its natural
consequences. New Jersey claims the right to levy
a tax for State revenue on passengers and freight in
transit across her territory from State to State,&mdash;in
other words, to levy a tax on “commerce among the
several States.” Of course the right to tax is the right
to prohibit. The same power which can exact “ten
cents from every passenger,” according to the cry of the
Camden and Amboy Railroad, by the voice of its counsel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
may exact ten dollars, or any other sum, and thus
effectively close this great avenue of communication.</p>

<p>Again, if New Jersey can successfully play this game
of taxation, and compel tribute from the domestic commerce
of the Union traversing her territory on the way
from State to State, then may every other State do likewise.
New York, with her central power, may build up
an overshadowing monopoly and a boundless revenue,
while all the products and population of the West traversing
her territory on the way to the sea, and all the
products and population of the East, with the contributions
of foreign commerce, traversing her territory on the
way to the West, are compelled to pay tribute. Pennsylvania,
holding a great highway of the Union,&mdash;Maryland,
constituting an essential link in the chain of communication
with the national capital,&mdash;Ohio, spanning
from lake to river, and forming a mighty ligament of
States, east and west,&mdash;Indiana, enjoying the same
unsurpassed opportunities,&mdash;Illinois, girdled by States
with all of which it is dovetailed by railroads, east and
west, north and south,&mdash;Kentucky, guarding the gates of
the Southwest,&mdash;and, finally, any one of the States on the
long line of the Pacific Railroad,&mdash;may enter upon a
similar career of unscrupulous exaction, until anarchy
sits supreme, and there are as many different tributes
as there are States. If the Union should continue to
exist, it would be only as a name. The national unity
would be destroyed.</p>

<p>The taste of revenue is to a government like the
taste of blood to a wild beast, exciting and maddening
the energies, so that it becomes deaf to suggestions
of justice; and the difficulties must increase, where
this taxation is enforced by a comprehensive monopoly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
The State, once tasting this blood, sees only an
easy way of obtaining the means it desires; and other
States will yield to the same temptation. The poet,
after picturing vice as a monster of frightful mien, tells
us in familiar words,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face,</div>
<div class="verse">We first endure, then pity, then embrace.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A profitable Usurpation, like that of New Jersey, would
be a tempting example to other States. “It is only the
first step that costs.” Let this Usurpation be sanctioned
by Congress, and you hand over the domestic
commerce of the Union to a succession of local imposts.
Each State will be a tax-gatherer at the expense of the
Union. Each State will play the part of Don Quixote,
and the Union will be Sancho Panza, not only bound
to contributions, but driven to receive on bare back the
lashes which were the penance of the knightly adventurer.
If there be any single fruit of our national
unity, if there be any single element of the Union, if
there be any single triumph of the Constitution to be
placed above all others, it is the freedom of commerce
between the States, under which <i>free trade</i>, the aspiration
of philosophy, is assured to all citizens of the
Union, as they circulate through our whole broad country,
without hindrance from any State. But this vital
principle is now in jeopardy.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that it is the tax imposed on commerce
between New York and Philadelphia, two cities outside
the State of New Jersey, which I denounce. I have
denounced it as hostile to the Union. I also denounce
it as hostile to the spirit of the age, which is everywhere
overturning the barriers of commerce. The robber
castles, once compelling payment of toll on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Rhine, were long ago dismantled, and exist now only
as monuments of picturesque beauty. Kindred pretensions
in other places have been overthrown or trampled
out. Duties levied by Denmark on all vessels passing
through the Sound and the Belts, duties levied by Hanover
on the goods of all nations at Stade on the Elbe,
tolls exacted on the Danube in its protracted course,
tolls exacted by Holland on the busy waters of the
Scheldt, and transit imposts within the great Zollverein
of Germany, have all been abolished; and in this
work of enfranchisement the Government of the United
States led the way, insisting, in the words of President
Pierce, in his Annual Message, “on the right of <i>free
transit</i> into and from the Baltic.”<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> But the right of free
transit across the States of the Union is now assailed.
Can you who reached so far to secure <i>free transit</i> in
the Baltic now hesitate in its defence here at home?</p>

<p>Thank God, within the bounds of the Union, under
the National Constitution, commerce is made free. As
the <i>open sea</i> is the highway of nations, so is this Union
made the highway of the States, with all their commerce,
and no State can claim any exclusive property therein.
The Union is a <i>mare liberum</i>, beyond the power of any
State, and not a <i>mare clausum</i>, subject to as many tyrannies
as there are States. And yet the State of New
Jersey asserts the power of closing a highway of the
Union.</p>

<p>Such a pretension, so irrational and destructive, cannot
be dealt with tenderly. Like the serpent, it must
be bruised on the head. Nor can there be wise delay.
Every moment of life yielded to such a Usurpation is
like the concession once in an evil hour yielded to Nullification,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
kindred in origin and character. The present
pretension of New Jersey belongs to the same school
with that abhorred and blood-bespattered pretension of
South Carolina.</p>

<p>Perhaps, Sir, it is not unnatural that the doctrines of
South Carolina on State Rights should obtain shelter in
New Jersey. Like sees like. There is a common bond
among the sciences, among the virtues, among the
vices,&mdash;and so, also, among the monopolies. The monopoly
founded on the hideous pretension of property
in man obtained responsive sympathy in that other monopoly
founded on the greed of unjust taxation, and
both were naturally upheld in the name of State Rights.
Both must be overthrown in the name of the Union.
South Carolina must cease to be a Slave State, and
New Jersey must also cease her disturbing pretension.
All hail to the genius of Universal Emancipation! All
hail to the Union, victorious over the Rebellion,&mdash;victorious,
also, over a Usurpation which menaces the
unity of the Republic!</p>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Remarks in the Senate, on the Credentials of Hon. Joseph
Segar, of Virginia, February 17, 1865.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>February 17th, Mr. Willey, of West Virginia, presented the credentials
of Hon. Joseph Segar, appointed Senator by a State Government
of Virginia, sitting at Alexandria. Mr. Sumner moved their
reference to the Committee on the Judiciary, and during the discussion
that ensued said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">I regret that a question of this magnitude has
been precipitated upon the Senate at this late period
of the session, when there is so much public business
which has not yet received the attention of either
House of Congress. The Senator from Michigan [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Howard</span>] does not exaggerate its magnitude. Sir, it is
much to be a Senator of the United States, with all the
powers and privileges pertaining to that office, legislative,
diplomatic, and executive; and the question is,
whether all these shall be recognized in the gentleman
whose certificate has been sent to the Chair. I thought
it my duty, on hearing the certificate read as I entered
the Chamber, to move its reference to the Committee
on the Judiciary. I am astonished that there can be
any hesitation in that reference. Senators who hesitate
show insensibility to the character of the question.
Will the Senate act blindfold, or with eyes open? I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
insist that on such a question it shall act with eyes
open, wide open; and I know no way in which this
can be accomplished, except through the intervention
of a responsible Committee. Therefore, Sir, I proposed
that the credentials should be referred. It will be
the duty of the Committee, as my friend from Michigan
suggests, to consider, in the first place, whether a
State in armed rebellion, like Virginia, can have Senators
on this floor. That is a great question, constitutional,
political, practical. It will be their duty then
to consider whether the gentleman whose credentials
are before us is the legal choice of any State under the
National Constitution. Now, Sir, I do not intend to
prejudge either of these questions. I simply open them
for consideration.</p>

<p>I say, Sir, I do not mean to prejudge these questions;
but I do insist that a measure of this importance shall
not be acted on without due consideration, and in absolute
indifference to facts staring us in the face, glaring
upon us every day in every newspaper that we read.
Sir, you cannot be insensible to facts. It is in vain
that Senators say that Virginia, now in war against the
Union, is entitled to representation on this floor, when
you have before you the inexorable fact that the greater
part of the State is at this moment in the possession
of an armed Rebellion, and that other fact, repeated by
the newspapers of the land, that the body of men who
have undertaken to send a Senator to Congress are little
more than the Common Council of Alexandria. The
question is distinctly presented, whether a representative
of the Common Council of Alexandria is to enter
this Chamber, and share the powers and privileges of
my honorable friend near me, the Senator from New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
York [Mr. <span class="smcap">Morgan</span>], or my friend farther from me, the
Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. <span class="smcap">Cowan</span>]. I merely
open these points, without undertaking to decide them,
but simply as an unanswerable argument in favor of
the reference.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Afterwards, in reply to Mr. Foster, of Connecticut, Mr. Sumner
said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Suppose it was matter of public notoriety that I
came into this Chamber with a certificate from a body
of men in Boston, little more in number and character
than the Common Council of that city, not in fact supposed
to represent the State; suppose this fact much
received in the country; then I submit to the Senator
whether it would not be the duty of the Senate, before
receiving my credentials, to inquire into their origin.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The debate continued, when Mr. Sherman, of Ohio, moved that
the credentials lie on the table. The motion was adopted,&mdash;Yeas
29, Nays 13. Mr. Segar’s claim to a seat was never prosecuted.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>February 17th, Mr. Sumner introduced the following concurrent

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Whereas certain persons have put in circulation
the report, that, on the suppression of the
Rebellion, the Rebel debt or loan may be recognized

which the United States can never, under any

<p>Mr. Saulsbury and Mr. McDougall objecting, its consideration was
postponed. In the evening of the same day the resolution was taken

DECISION.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech in the Senate, on a Bill Providing for a Bust of the
late Chief Justice Taney, February 23, 1865.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>February 23d, Mr. Trumbull moved to proceed with the consideration
of a bill from the House of Representatives requiring the Joint
Committee of the two Houses on the Library to contract with a suitable
artist for the execution in marble, and delivery in the Supreme Court
Room of the United States, in the Capitol, of a bust of the late Chief
Justice Taney, and appropriating one thousand dollars for this purpose.
On the question of taking it up, Mr. Sumner said: “I object. An
emancipated country should not make a bust of the author of the Dred
Scott decision.” The motion to take up prevailed, when Mr. Sumner
said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I objected to this joint resolution,
when it was reported by the Senator from
Illinois [Mr. <span class="smcap">Trumbull</span>], and he was disposed to hurry
it upon the Senate, to the exclusion of important business.
I objected to it again to-day; but it was from no
indisposition to discuss it.</p>

<p>I know well the trivial apology which may be made
for this proposition, and the Senator from Maryland
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>] has already shown something of the
hardihood with which it may be defended. In the performance
of public duty I am indifferent to both.</p>

<p>The apology is too obvious. “Nothing but good of
the dead.” This is a familiar saying, which, to a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
extent, is acknowledged. But it is entirely inapplicable,
when statues and busts are proposed in honor
of the dead. Then, at least, truth must prevail.</p>

<p>If a man has done evil during life, he must not be
complimented in marble. And if indiscreetly it is proposed
to decree this signal honor, then the evil he has
done must be exposed; nor shall any false delicacy seal
my lips. It is not enough that he held high place, that
he enjoyed worldly honors, or was endowed with intellectual
gifts.</p>

<div class="verse">“Who wickedly is wise, or madly brave,</div>
<div class="verse">Is but the more a fool, the more a knave.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>What is the office of Chief Justice, if it has been
used to betray Human Rights? The crime is great
according to the position of the criminal.</p>

<p>If asked, Sir, to mention the incident of our history,
previous to the Rebellion, most worthy of condemnation,
most calculated to cause the blush of shame, and
most deadly in its consequences, I do not doubt that
you would name the Dred Scott decision, and especially
the unhallowed assertion of the Chief Justice.
I say this with pain. I do not seek this debate. But
when a proposition is made to honor the author of
this enormity with a commemorative bust, at the expense
of the country, I am obliged to speak plainly.</p>

<p>I am not aware that the English judges who decided
contrary to Liberty in the case of ship-money, sustaining
the king in those pretensions which ended in Civil
War, have ever been commemorated in marble. I am
not aware that Jeffreys, Chief Justice and Chancellor of
England, famous for talents as for crimes, has found
any niche in Westminster Hall. No, Sir. They have
been left to the judgment of history; and there I insist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
that Taney shall be left in sympathetic companionship.
Each was the tool of unjust power. But the power
Taney served was none other than that Slave Power
which has involved the country in hideous war.</p>

<p>I speak what cannot be denied, when I declare that
the opinion of the Chief Justice in the case of Dred
Scott was more thoroughly abominable than anything
of the kind in the history of courts. Then and there
judicial baseness reached its lowest point. You have
not forgotten that terrible decision, where an unrighteous
judgment was sustained by falsification of history.
Of course the Constitution of the United States and
every principle of Liberty were falsified; but historical
truth was falsified also. I have here the authentic
report of the case, where it appears that the Chief Justice,
while enforcing his unjust conclusion, blasting a
whole race, used the following language.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is difficult at this day to realize the state of public
opinion in relation to that unfortunate race, which prevailed
in the civilized and enlightened portions of the world <i>at the
time of the Declaration of Independence, and when the Constitution
of the United States was framed and adopted. But the
public history of every European nation displays it in a manner
too plain to be mistaken.</i></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
<p>“They had for more than a century before been regarded
as beings of an inferior order, and altogether unfit to associate
with the white race, either in social or political relations,&mdash;<i>and
so far inferior, that they had no rights which the white
man was bound to respect</i>, and that the negro might justly
and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his benefit. He was
bought and sold, and treated as an ordinary article of merchandise
and traffic, whenever a profit could be made by it.
<i>This opinion was at that time fixed and universal in the civilized
portion of the white race.</i> It was regarded as an axiom
in morals as well as in politics, which no one thought of disputing,
or supposed to be open to dispute.”<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In these words, solemnly and authoritatively uttered
by the Chief Justice of the United States, humanity
and truth were set at nought, and the whole country
was humbled. “Then I and you and all of us fell
down, whilst bloody <i>Slavery</i> flourished over us.”</p>

<p>I quote his words fully, so that there can be no
mistake. Here, then, is his expressed assertion, that
at the Declaration of Independence in 1776, and the
adoption of the National Constitution in 1789, in
Europe as well as in our own country, colored men
were regarded as having “no rights which the white
man was bound to respect.” Now, Sir, this is false,&mdash;terribly
false. It is notorious that there were States
of the Union, where, at the adoption of the Constitution,
colored persons were free, and even in the enjoyment
of the electoral franchise, while in England the
Somerset case had already decided that there could
be no distinction of persons on account of color, and
Scotland, France, and Holland had all declared the
same rule. Even Spain had spoken by the voice of
some of her best children. So had Portugal. So also
had Italy, and the Catholic Church. On this point
there is no question. And yet this Chief Justice,
whom you would honor with a marble bust, had the
strange effrontery to declare that at that time, as well
abroad as at home, colored men were regarded as
having “no rights which the white man was bound to
respect”; and this he said to justify a brutal interpretation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
of the Constitution. Search judicial annals
and you find no perversion of truth more flagrant.</p>

<p>Sir, it is not fit, it is not decent, that such a person
should be commemorated by a vote of Congress,&mdash;especially
at this time, when Liberty is at last recognized.
If you have money to commemorate the dead,
let it be in honor of the defenders of Liberty gathered
to their fathers. There was John Quincy Adams.
There, also, was Joshua R. Giddings. Let their busts
be placed in the Court-Room, where with marble lips
they can plead always for human rights, teaching judge
and advocate the glory and the beauty of justice. Then
will you do something not entirely unworthy of a regenerated
land, something to be an example for future
times, something to help fix the standard of history.</p>

<p>I know that in the Court-Room there are busts of
the other Chief Justices. Very well. So in the Hall
of the Doges, at Venice, there are pictures of all who
filled that high office in unbroken succession, with the
exception of Marino Falieri, who, although as venerable
from years as Taney, was deemed unworthy of a
place in the historic line. Where his picture should
have been is a vacant space, testifying always to the
justice of the Republic. Let such a vacant space in
our Court-Room testify to the justice of our Republic,
and may it speak in warning to every one who would
betray Liberty!</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The appropriation was vindicated by Mr. Trumbull, Mr. Reverdy
Johnson, of Maryland, and Mr. Carlile, of West Virginia. It was
opposed by Mr. Hale, of New Hampshire, Mr. Wilson, of Massachusetts,
and Mr. Wade, of Ohio. Mr. Sumner then obtained the
floor.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>At last I have the floor again. I rose at once to
reply to the Senator from Maryland [Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>],
when he made his objurgatory vindication of the proposed
bust; but the floor was given to others. And
now, as I look at the clock, I see that I can only begin
what I have to say.</p>

<p>Again let me declare that I am sorry to be drawn
into this debate. But they who seek to canonize one
of the tools of Slavery are responsible. Taney shall
not be recognized as a saint by any vote of Congress,
if I can help it.</p>

<p>The Senator has a bad cause, and I inferred that he
thought so himself,&mdash;first, because he talked so loud,
and, secondly, because he became personal. A good
cause would have been discussed in softer voice, and
without personality. The Senator becomes personal
easily. In the sweep of his movement, he brushed
against my distinguished friend from New Hampshire
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Hale</span>], and also against my colleague and myself,
simply because we could not join in this oblation
to the author of the Dred Scott decision. The Senator
from New Hampshire and my colleague have
already answered him in proper terms. But I say for
my colleague what he could not say for himself. He
can bear gibes for not being a lawyer. He is not,
like the Senator, a counsellor of the Supreme Court
of the United States, but in all the duties of Senator
he is in every respect the equal of the Senator from
Maryland.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Here Mr. Sumner was arrested by the Vice-President announcing
that the hour fixed for a recess had arrived. The consideration of the
bill was never resumed, and it expired with the session. Had opportunity
occurred, Mr. Sumner would have continued:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>I have already said that Chief Justice Taney, in pronouncing
that fatal judgment, falsified history. Judicial
error is aggravated by such a falsification; and here
the evidence is complete. His statement is precise, that
for more than a century before the Declaration of Independence
and the adoption of our Constitution people
of the African race had “been regarded as beings of
an inferior order, and altogether unfit to associate with
the white race, either in social or political relations”;
and this unhappy asseveration culminates in the words,
“and so far inferior that they had no rights which the
white man was bound to respect, and that the negro
might justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his
benefit.” And he adds: “<i>This opinion was at that time
fixed and universal</i> in the civilized portion of the white
race. It was regarded as an axiom in morals, as well
as in politics, which no one thought of disputing or
<i>supposed to be open to dispute</i>.” This is plain, though
failing in the precision which belongs to the bench.
But how untrue! All this naturally ends in shutting
out the unhappy African from citizenship, involving the
right to sue in the courts of the United States.</p>

<p>Unhappily, at that time Slavery prevailed extensively;
but it had already received many blows, while the
rights of the African were asserted not only by individuals,
but by communities. Nay, more, from the beginning,
the axiom of the Chief Justice, which, according
to him, no one supposed open to dispute, had been
assailed. Great authorities, great names, together with
legislative and judicial bodies, stood forth against it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is Massachusetts, my own honored Commonwealth.
From the earliest days of her history Slavery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
found little favor with her Legislature or her people.
As early as 1645 the Legislature sent back two negroes
brought from Guinea in a Boston ship, and the next
year repeated its testimony against “the heinous and
crying sin of man-stealing.”<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> In the same spirit, John
Eliot, the apostle to the Indians, presented a memorial
to the Governor and Council against selling captured
Indians into slavery, saying, “To sell souls for money
seemeth to me a dangerous merchandise.”<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> In 1701,
Boston desired her Representatives in the General
Court “to promote the encouraging the bringing of
white servants, and to put a period to negroes being
slaves.”<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> At the same time Chief Justice Sewall, of a
family constant in warfare with Slavery, published a
tract entitled “The Selling of Joseph a Memorial,”
where he maintained that “originally and naturally
there is no such thing as Slavery,” and that “these
Ethiopians, as black as they are, seeing they are the
sons and daughters of the first Adam, the brethren and
sisters of the last Adam, and the offspring of God, they
ought to be treated with a respect agreeable.”<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> In this
spirit, the judicature of Massachusetts, in 1770, made
haste against Slavery, by declaring the principle of
Emancipation,&mdash;according to one authority, two years
before the famous Somerset case in England.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> This
was followed, in 1780, by the Declaration of Rights,
announcing that “all men are born free and equal,”
which the same judicature interpreted as abolishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
Slavery; so that at the adoption of the National Constitution
Slavery did not exist in Massachusetts. That
this undoubted history should have been disregarded
by the Chief Justice is more astonishing, when it is
considered that the conclusion belonged to the jurisprudence
of our country. In a case well known to all
interested in the history of Slavery, and especially to
lawyers, decided in 1836, Chief Justice Shaw said:
“How, or by what act particularly, Slavery was abolished
in Massachusetts, whether by the adoption of
the opinion in Somerset’s case, as a declaration and
modification of the Common Law, or by the Declaration
of Independence, or by the [State] Constitution
of 1780, it is not now very easy to determine; and it
is rather a matter of curiosity than of utility, <i>it being
agreed on all hands</i>, that, if not abolished before, it
was so by the Declaration of Rights.”<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> And yet even
these words are forgotten in this fatal decision.</p>

<p>Here we must mention Rhode Island with honor.
This State, planted by Roger Williams, may point
with pride to her early record on Slavery. At a General
Court held May 19, 1652, after setting forth,
that “there is a common course practised amongst
Englishmen to buy negroes, to that end they may have
them for service or slaves forever,” it was ordered,
“that no black mankind, or white, being forced by
covenant bond, or otherwise, to serve any man or his
assigns longer than ten years, or until they come to
be twenty-four years of age, if they be taken in under
fourteen, from the time of their coming within the liberties
of this colony.”<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> If Rhode Island afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
departed from this law, it existed, nevertheless, as an
example not to be forgotten by the Chief Justice.
Nor should he have forgotten that Pennsylvania, as
early as 1712, passed an act to prevent the increase
of slaves, although it was annulled by the Crown,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
and that this same State enacted, March 1, 1780, that
all persons born in that State after that day were free
at the age of twenty-eight years.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> But all this is inconsistent
with the famous “axiom” on which the
Chief Justice founded his fearful superstructure.</p>

<p>I need go no further than the dissenting opinion of
Mr. Justice Curtis, on this very occasion, to find, that,
“at the time of the ratification of the Articles of Confederation,
all free native-born inhabitants of New
Hampshire, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey,
and North Carolina, though descended from African
slaves, were not only citizens of those States, but such
of them as had the other necessary qualifications possessed
the franchise of electors on equal terms with
other citizens.”<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Was all this forgotten by the Chief
Justice? But how could he forget the decision of the
admirable Judge Gaston, of North Carolina, who, describing
the State Constitution of 1776, says, that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
“extended the elective franchise to every freeman who
had arrived at the age of twenty-one and paid a public
tax; and it is a matter of universal notoriety, that,
under it, free persons, without regard to color, claimed
and exercised the franchise, until it was taken from
free men of color a few years since by our amended
Constitution”?<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>Strangely, he forgets also an important passage of
history, being nothing less than the point-blank refusal
of the Continental Congress to insert the word “white”
in the Articles of Confederation. The question came up
June 25, 1778, on these words: “The <i>Free Inhabitants</i>
of each of these States (paupers, vagabonds, and fugitives
from justice excepted) shall be entitled to all
privileges and immunities of <i>free citizens</i> in the several
States.” The delegates from South Carolina, acting in
the spirit of the Dred Scott decision, moved, in behalf
of their State, to limit this guaranty to “free <i>white</i>
inhabitants.” On the question of inserting the word
“white,” eleven States voted, two in favor of the insertion,
one was divided, and eight were against it. South
Carolina, not disheartened, made another attempt, by
moving to add, after the words “the several States,” the
further clause, “according to the law of such States
respectively for the government of their own <i>free white</i>
inhabitants,” thus seeking again to limit the operation
of this guaranty. This proposition was also voted
down by the same decisive majority of eight to three.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
Such was the authoritative testimony of our fathers.
And in harmony with this action was the Resolution
for the Temporary Government of the Western Territory
“ceded or to be ceded by individual States to
the United States,” dated April 23, 1784, and drawn
by Jefferson, and also the famous Ordinance for the
Government of the Northwestern Territory, drawn by
Nathan Dane, of Massachusetts, adopted by the Confederation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
July 13, 1787, in both of which the voters
were without distinction of color.</p>

<p>Still more incomprehensible is the assertion of the
Chief Justice, when we glance at the political literature
of our country. Not only in Massachusetts, but elsewhere,
the “axiom” of the Chief Justice, “which no
one thought of disputing, or supposed to be open to
dispute,” was denied. Nobody did this in more energetic
terms than General Oglethorpe, the founder of
Georgia, who, in a letter to Granville Sharp, wrote,
under date of October 13, 1776: “My friends and I
settled the colony of Georgia, and by charter were established
trustees, to make laws, &amp;c. We determined
not to suffer Slavery there.… We would not suffer
Slavery (which is against the Gospel, as well as
the fundamental law of England) to be authorized
under our authority; we refused, as trustees, to make
a law permitting such a horrid crime.”<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> In the same
spirit, John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, who
had witnessed the workings of Slavery on our continent
and in the West Indies, declared “American
Slavery the vilest that ever saw the sun,” and the
“execrable sum of all villanies.” “Men-buyers” he
stigmatizes as “exactly on a level with men-stealers,”
the slaveholder as “partaker with a thief, and not a
jot honester,” and the means whereby slaves are procured
as “nothing near so innocent as picking of pockets,
housebreaking, or robbery upon the highway.”<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
So also spoke James Otis, in his famous pamphlet
entitled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> “The Rights of the British Colonists Asserted
and Proved,” first published in 1764, and reprinted in
London, when he said: “The Colonists are, by the
Law of Nature, free-born, as, indeed, all men are, white
or black.… Does it follow that it is right to enslave
a man because he is black? Will short curled hair, like
wool, instead of Christian hair, as it is called by those
whose hearts are as hard as the nether millstone, help
the argument? Can any logical inference in favor of
Slavery be drawn from a flat nose, a long or a short
face?”<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> And so spoke Benjamin Rush, the patriot physician
of Philadelphia, in “An Address to the Inhabitants
of the British Settlements on the Slavery of the
Negroes in America,” where Slavery is exhibited as
“repugnant to the genius of Christianity” and inconsistent
with “the justice and goodness of the Supreme
Being,” and “a Christian slave” is called “a contradiction
in terms.”<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> To these testimonies add the familiar
words of statesmen, especially of Patrick Henry, “It is
a debt that we owe to the purity of our religion, to
show that it is at variance with that law that warrants
Slavery,”<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>&mdash;and of Jefferson, in that memorable
utterance, prompted by Slavery, “I tremble for my
country, when I reflect that God is just, that His justice
cannot sleep forever.”<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> All these sayings, directly
repellent to the allegation of the Chief Justice, have
often been cited in public speech, and most of them appear
in a work entitled “Slavery and Antislavery,” by
that devoted Abolitionist, William Goodell, published
several years before the opinion of the Chief Justice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>Forgetting laws, judicial decisions, history, and political
literature, it was easy for the Chief Justice to forget
how the religious sects of the country testified for
the rights of the African, sometimes by individuals, and
sometimes by corporate acts. Here the Quakers took
the lead. As far back as 1688, a small body of German
Quakers at Germantown, Pennsylvania, presented
a protest to the Yearly Meeting against “buying, selling,
and holding men in slavery,”<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> which was followed
in 1696 by formal advice from this body that the members
should “be careful not to encourage the bringing
in of any more negroes, and that such that have negroes
be careful of them.”<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> One of their number,
George Keith, denounced Slavery with especial vigor,
as “contrary to the religion of Christ, the rights of
man, and sound reason and policy.”<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> At the beginning
of the last century the Quakers of New England
were agitated. In 1716, they sent forth a declaration
from Nantucket, that “it is not agreeable to truth
for Friends to purchase slaves and keep them term
of life;”<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> and in 1730, Elihu Coleman, of Nantucket,
wrote a tract in reprobation of Slavery as “anti-Christian,”
and “very opposite both to Grace and Nature.”<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
In 1729, at Philadelphia, Ralph Sandiford
exposed it in a pamphlet entitled “The Mystery of
Iniquity”; and in 1737, Benjamin Lay gave to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
world his work with the expressive title, “All Slave-Keepers,
that keep the Innocent in Bondage, Apostates,”&mdash;and
this was printed by Benjamin Franklin.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
Then came the extraordinary labors of John Woolman,
who, from 1746 to 1768, travelled through the
Middle and Southern Colonies, an avowed Abolitionist,
testifying against Slavery,&mdash;and of Anthony Benezet,
who, by various writings, and by gratuitous instruction
of negroes at an evening school, showed his
sense of their common humanity. Meanwhile at their
Yearly Meetings Slavery was condemned. In 1754,
there was a recommendation “to advise and deal with
such as engage” in the traffic, with the declared desire
to guard against “promoting the bondage of such unhappy
people.”<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> In 1776, it was declared “that the
owners of slaves who refused to execute proper instruments
for giving them their freedom were to be disowned.”<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
There are also reports of meetings,&mdash;in
Rhode Island, in 1717, 1727, 1760, 1769, and thence,
nearly every year, to 1787,&mdash;in New York, previous
to 1759, and in 1767, 1771, 1772, 1774, 1775, 1776,
1777, 1781, 1782, 1784, 1785, 1787,&mdash;and in Virginia,
in 1757, 1764, 1766, 1767, 1768, 1773, 1780, and
thence annually, with but one intermission, to 1787,&mdash;where
the rights of the African were recognized,
and in most of them Slavery was condemned.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> The
meeting of 1782, in Rhode Island, spoke of “that iniquitous
practice of holding or dealing with mankind
as slaves.”<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> The meeting of 1776, in New York, refused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
“to employ or accept the services in the church,
or receive the collections,” of those “who continue
these poor people in bondage.”<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> The meeting of 1773,
in Virginia, earnestly recommended manumissions, and
quoted the words of the Prophet, “The people of the
land have used oppression and exercised robbery.”<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
These are only illustrations of the extent to which the
pretension of the Chief Justice was disowned.</p>

<p>More tardily, but with equal force, the Methodists declared
against Slavery, speaking by such great preachers
as George Whitefield and John Wesley. From the
historian Hildreth, whose work appeared some time
before the Dred Scott decision, we learn that the
Methodist Episcopal Church, just before the adoption
of the Constitution, disqualified slaveholders from
being members, and that Coke, the first bishop, was exceedingly
jealous on this subject, although, unhappily,
the rule was afterwards relaxed.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> The Presbyterians
of the United Synod of New York and Philadelphia,
in 1787, proposed nothing less than “to procure eventually
the final Abolition of Slavery in America.”<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
The Baptists of Virginia, in 1789, declared Slavery
“a violent deprivation of the rights of Nature, and
inconsistent with republican government.”<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> The Congregationalists
of New England testified most brilliantly
by the celebrated theologian, Samuel Hopkins, who
brought his church at Newport to declare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> “the slave-trade
and the slavery of the Africans, as it has taken
place among us, is a gross violation of the righteousness
and benevolence which are so much inculcated
in the Gospel, and therefore we will not tolerate it in
this church.”<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> Already, in 1776, he had put forth
a tract, showing it to be the duty and interest of
the American Colonies to emancipate all their African
slaves, and declaring that Slavery is “in every instance
wrong, unrighteousness, and oppression, a very great
and crying sin, there being nothing of the kind equal
to it on the face of the earth”;<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> and in 1791, soon
after the adoption of the National Constitution, the
second Jonathan Edwards, a twice-honored name, joined
in this testimony.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> But all this was forgotten by the
Chief Justice.</p>

<p>Nor did he remember how, before the National Constitution,
the opposition to Slavery, and sympathy with
the African, found expression in Abolition Societies.
That of Pennsylvania was formed in 1775, and bore
the honorable title, “Society for the Abolition of
Slavery, the Relief of Free Negroes unlawfully held
in Bondage, and for improving the African Race.” Its
President at the very adoption of the Constitution was
Benjamin Franklin, who, in this post, as elsewhere,
bore his testimony that the African had rights which
the white man was bound to respect. In 1785 began
in New York a “Society for promoting the Manumission
of Slaves, and protecting such of them as have
been or may be liberated,” with John Jay as President,
who, like Franklin, bore his testimony in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
post, as elsewhere. In 1786, this distinguished individual
drafted and signed a memorial to the Legislature
of New York against Slavery, declaring that the men
held as slaves by the laws of the State were free by
the law of God; and this memorial was signed by
Robert R. Livingston and Alexander Hamilton. In
Maryland, the State of the Chief Justice, an Abolition
Society was formed in 1789, and among its officers were
Samuel Chase, a signer of the Declaration of Independence,
and Luther Martin, a member of the Convention
that framed the National Constitution. How active
these societies were in petitioning Congress, shortly
afterwards, belongs to the history of our country. A
petition was headed by Franklin, which, after pleading
for the rights of all, “without distinction of color,” entreated
Congress that it would “step to the very verge
of the power vested in it, for discouraging every species
of traffic in the persons of our fellow-men.”<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> All
this is found in so common a book as the history by
William Goodell, already quoted; but the Chief Justice
knew it not.</p>

<p>I call attention especially to Maryland, where, at
the very date of the Constitution, and in the Legislature
of the State, a generous voice was lifted against
Slavery by no less a person than William Pinkney,
so famous as diplomatist, Senator, and consummate
lawyer. He did not spare words. According to
him, Slavery was “iniquitous and most dishonorable,”
“founded in a disgraceful traffic,” “its continuance as
shameful as its origin,”&mdash;and he bravely declared, that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
“by the eternal principles of natural justice, no master
in the State has a right to hold his slave in bondage
for a single hour.”<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> There also was the neighbor State
of Delaware, where, at the beginning of our Revolution,
under date of “Wilmington, Sixth Month 20th, 1775,”
Daniel Byrnes put forth a broadside entitled “A Short
Address to the English Colonies in North America,”
where he exposes the wrong to the African, and inquires,
“How can any have the confidence to put up
their addresses to a God of impartial justice, and ask
of Him success in a struggle for freedom, who at the
same time are keeping others in a state of abject
slavery?” But the Chief Justice, whose long life was
passed near the home of Pinkney and of Byrnes, yet,
in face of their unanswerable testimony, utters his
strange extravagance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Pass now to England, and here the falsification is
kindred to that I have exposed with regard to our
own country; and when we consider how English law,
English history, and English literature are familiar to
all educated lawyers among us, it is painful to observe
the strange oblivion that overcame the Chief
Justice with regard to their most brilliant chapters.</p>

<p>As early as 1569, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth,
occurred the famous case of the slave brought from
Russia, whose master sought to scourge him, when it
was grandly resolved that “England was too pure an
air for slaves to breathe in.”<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> This case was cited by
the managers of the Commons, during the Long Parliament,
on the impeachment of the judges for their proceedings
against John Lilburn and John Wharton;<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
that it took a conspicuous place, not only in English
law, but also in political history. The same principle
is also found in the Introduction to Holinshed’s Chronicles,
written in 1586, where, describing England, it is
said: “As for slaves and bondmen, we have none;
nay, such is the privilege of our country, by the especial
grace of God and bounty of our princes, that,
if any come hither from other realms, so soon as they
set foot on land they become so free of condition as
their masters, whereby all note of servile bondage
is utterly removed from them.”<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Such was English
law at that early day, according to great authorities.
And in the reign of Charles the First the same humanity
appeared in literature, when Fuller, describing
“the Good Sea-Captain,” says, “In taking a prize, he
most prizeth the men’s lives whom he takes, though
some of them may chance to be negroes or savages”;
and then, “But our captain counts the image of God
nevertheless His image cut in ebony, as if done in
ivory.”<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>Other cases followed. In the time of Queen Anne,
Lord Chief Justice Holt decided that “as soon as a
negro comes into England he becomes free: one may
be a villein in England, but not a slave”; and Mr.
Justice Powell, his associate, said, “The law takes no
notice of a negro,”<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>&mdash;in other words, recognizes no
difference between him and a white man. As early as
1696, the same eminent Chief Justice, giving judgment
in another case, said, “Trover will not lie for a negro.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
In 1706, in still another case, he said, “The Common
Law takes no notice of negroes being different from
other men.”<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Lord Campbell, referring to some of
these authorities, in his Life of the Chief Justice, says
that he “was the first to lay down the doctrine, which
was afterwards fully established in the case of Somerset
the Negro, that the <i>status</i> of Slavery cannot exist
in England, and that as soon as a slave breathes the
air of England he is free.”<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> In 1762, Lord Northington,
deciding a case in Chancery where the master
claimed the benefit in donation to a negro, said:
“As soon as a man puts foot on English ground he is
free; a negro may maintain an action against his master
for ill usage, and may have a <i>Habeas Corpus</i>, if
restrained of his liberty.”<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> These cases were crowned
by the immortal judgment of Lord Mansfield in the
Somerset case, where, after elaborate argument at the
bar, and protracted adjournments of the court, it was
solemnly decided, in 1772, that Slavery “is so odious
that nothing can be suffered to support it but <i>positive
law</i>,”<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> and since no such law could be shown in England,
Slavery was impossible there. This case, besides
constituting an epoch in the history of Liberty, is
memorable for the argument of that learned lawyer,
Francis Hargrave, undoubtedly a masterpiece of the
English bar. It has been cited so constantly since,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
that nothing short of the waters of Lethe can account
for the forgetfulness of the Chief Justice with regard
to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>Scotland, although having a different jurisprudence,
asserted the same principle, side by side with England.
Sir Thomas Craig, in his work on Feudal Law, one of
the chief monuments of Scottish jurisprudence, testifies
that Slavery was unknown in his country in the reign
of Queen Elizabeth, when he also flourished, and that
there were no laws to regulate it.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> In 1778, the question
was presented to the courts on the claim of a master
over a negro and it was found, on appeal, “that the
dominion assumed over this negro under the law of
Jamaica, being unjust, could not be supported in this
country to any extent; that, therefore, the defendant
had no right to the negro’s service for any space of
time, nor to send him out of the country against his
consent.”<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The literature of both countries was in harmony with
the jurisprudence. Here I give the words of two Englishmen,
John Locke and Samuel Johnson, and two
Scotchmen, Adam Smith and David Hume. John
Locke portrayed Slavery as “so vile and miserable an
estate of man, and so directly opposite to the generous
temper and courage of our nation, that it is hardly to be
conceived that an Englishman, much less a gentleman,
should plead for it.”<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Samuel Johnson exhibited “the
planters of America” as “a race of mortals whom no
other man wishes to resemble.”<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Adam Smith wrote:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
“There is not a negro from the coast of Africa who does
not, in respect to contempt of death and torture, possess
a degree of magnanimity which the soul of his sordid
master is too often scarce capable of conceiving.”<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> I
quote David Hume at length, because his testimony is
less known.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The remains which are found of Domestic Slavery in
the American colonies and among some European nations
would never, surely, create a desire of rendering it more universal.
The little humanity commonly observed in persons
accustomed from their infancy to exercise so great authority
over their fellow-creatures, and to trample upon human
nature, were sufficient alone to disgust us with that unbounded
dominion. Nor can a more probable reason be
assigned for the severe, I might say barbarous, manners of
ancient times than the practice of domestic slavery, by
which every man of rank was rendered a petty tyrant, and
educated amidst the flattery, submission, and low debasement
of his slaves.”<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is not improbable that this passage suggested to
Colonel Mason, of Virginia, his condemnation of Slavery,
as producing “the most pernicious effect on manners;
every master of slaves is born a petty tyrant”;<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
and also the remarkable representation by Jefferson of
the effect on “manners,” when he says, “The whole
commerce between master and slave is a perpetual exercise
of the most boisterous passions, the most unremitting
despotism on the one part, and degrading submission
on the other.”<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>To this increasing testimony, where philosophy and
literature unite, against the “axiom” of our Chief Justice,
I add that of Granville Sharp, England’s earliest
Abolitionist, who, more than any other person, was
inspired to bear witness. Through his persistent purpose
the case of Somerset was presented for hearing
and pressed to judgment. The “axiom” was rejected
by his life. In 1769, he wrote a tract entitled “A Representation
of the Injustice and Dangerous Tendency of
tolerating Slavery, or of admitting the least Claim of
Private Property in the Persons of Men, in England.”
Others followed. At the same time he was the watchful
guardian of colored persons, offering them friendly
protection.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Poetry and eloquence gave expression to the proud
declaration of English law. Cowper’s “Task” appeared
in 1785, with the exulting words,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>Sheridan took up the strain, and in one of his best
utterances said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Allegiance to that Power that gives us the <i>forms</i> of men
commands us to maintain the <i>rights</i> of men; and never yet
was this truth dismissed from the human heart,&mdash;never in
any time, in any age,&mdash;never in any clime where rude man
ever had any social feeling, or where corrupt refinement had
subdued all feelings; never was this one unextinguishable
truth destroyed from the heart of man, placed as it is in the
core and centre of it by his Maker, that man was not made
the property of man.”<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>The same sentiment reappeared in the immortal
outburst of Curran, which was the highest testimony
to English law. And yet none of these are recognized
by our Chief Justice.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In assertion of the general principle, France was not
behind England. Schoell, in his “History of Treaties of
Peace,” referring to this principle, says that in France
“the beautiful maxim has always been followed, that
whoever sets foot on French soil in Europe is free,&mdash;a
maxim which, as we have said, the English tribunals
did not adopt till 1772.”<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> Doubtless the general principle
may be traced to an early period of French history.
It was a frequent boast, and there are instances
of its application. An edict of Louis the Tenth, called
<i>Le Hutin</i>, or The Quarreller, in 1315, and another of
Henry the Second, in 1553, are quoted as declaring the
right of all men to liberty by the Law of Nature. At
the siege of Metz, in 1552, the Spanish general of cavalry
applied to the French commander for the return of
a fugitive slave; but the latter replied, that the freedom
acquired by the slave, according to the ancient and
good custom of France, did not permit his rendition.
In 1571, the same principle was maintained against an
ambassador, although by the Law of Nations the persons
an ambassador brings with him do not change
their condition.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>These cases are mentioned in the “Causes Célèbres,”
a well-known French collection of important trials;
and the principle is attested by French authorities in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
jurisprudence, among which may be named Lebret, and
also Loysel, whose works are found in the Library of
Congress. I mention especially the “Institutes Coutumières”
of Loysel, with the various notes of Laurière,
Dupin, and Laboulaye, the last being the very loyal
ally of our country, where this principle is stated and
illustrated.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>The case of the slave at Metz deserves further mention.
He had escaped from the besieging general, and
taken with him a Spanish horse. The Duke of Guise,
who commanded in the city, returned for answer to the
application for his surrender, that he could not comply;
that his hands were tied by the law of France from
time immemorial; that, entirely free as it had been
and is, it would not receive a slave: and so it would
be, if he were the most barbarous and foreign in the
world; having only set foot on the land of France, he
is immediately at liberty and beyond all slavery and
captivity, and is free as in his own country. The
slave could not be returned; but the horse was sent
back. The gay and lively Brantôme, who lived for
pleasure, was struck by this incident, and, after repeating
it “among other beautiful actions,” adds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Truly, we must praise and admire that noble freedom,
beautiful and Christian, in France, not to admit such servitudes
and slaveries, too cruel, and which savor more of the
Pagan and Turk than of the Christian.”<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Bodin, in his work on Government, which first appeared
in French in 1576, must be quoted also. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
copy from the old translation by Knolles, published
in 1606.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But in France, although there be some remembrance of
old servitude, yet is it not lawful there to make any slave,
or to buy any of others: insomuch that the slaves of strangers,
so soon as they set their foot within France, become
frank and free; as was by an old decree of the Court of
Paris determined against an ambassador of Spain, who had
brought a slave with him into France. And I remember
that of late a Genoa merchant, having brought with him
unto Toulouse a slave whom he had bought in Spain, the
host of the house, understanding the matter, persuaded the
slave to appeal unto his liberty. The matter being brought
before the magistrates, the merchant was called for. The
Attorney General out of the records showed certain ancient
privileges given (as is said) unto them of Toulouse by
Theodosius the Great, wherein he had granted, that slaves,
so soon as they came into Toulouse, should be free: the
merchant alleging for himself, that he had truly bought
his slave in Spain, and so was afterward come to Toulouse,
from thence to go home to Genoa, and so not to be bound
to the laws of France. In the end, he requested, that, if
they would needs deal so hardly with him as to set at liberty
another man’s slave, yet they should at least restore
unto him the money he cost him: whereunto the judges
answered, that it was a matter to be considered of. In the
mean time, the merchant, fearing lest he should lose both
his dutiful slave and his money also, of himself set him at
liberty, yet covenanting with him that he should serve him
so long as he lived.”<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Nor was the principle restricted in application to
persons of a white skin. The fugitive slave at Metz<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
was a Moor or Turk. And there are other cases.
In 1571, a merchant of Normandy brought to Bordeaux
several Moors for sale; but the Parliament of
Guienne, by a solemn decree, discharged them from
slavery, “because France, the mother of Liberty, does
not permit any slaves.” Another case occurred in
the reign of Henry the Third, who, notwithstanding
the remonstrances of the Spanish ambassador, refused
to surrender two or three hundred “Turks, Moors, and
Barbarians” who had escaped from a Spanish galley,
but sent them all to Constantinople, each with a
crown-piece in his pocket. These cases also appear in
the authoritative pages to which I have already referred.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>That the African was no exception to the prevailing
principle in its original vigor appears in subsequent
cases. Unhappily, Slavery, exiled from France, found
a home in the French colonies, and then succeeded in
obtaining certain privileges even in France. By the
Edict of 1716 and the supplementary Declaration of
1738, the rights of the master over his slave in France
were recognized in certain cases. A slave escaping
from the colonies was surrendered, and the officers of
the Admiralty, and others whom it concerned, were
enjoined to assist the master in his recovery; but
where a master voluntarily brought or sent a slave
into France, he was obliged first to obtain permission
from the colonial governor, and register the same
both at his place of residence and the port of disembarkation.
With these considerable limitations the
great rule of France prevailed. The master was not
permitted to sell or exchange his slave in France;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
nor could he hold him, if he had failed to comply with
the required formalities.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>In 1738, the liberty of a slave brought from San
Domingo, and without compliance with prescribed formalities,
was recognized after an elaborate hearing by
the Admiralty. The general principle was presented
with much force. One of the counsel exclaimed: “In
France there are no slaves; and the custom is such
that not only Frenchmen, but also foreigners entering
a port of France, and crying, ‘<i>France and Liberty!</i>’ are
out of the power of him who possessed them, who loses
the purchase-money and the service of the slave, if the
slave refuse to serve him.”<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> This case, which testifies
against our Chief Justice, is found in a French collection
of Celebrated Trials, and there is a full abstract
of it in the notes to the case of Somerset in Howell’s
edition of the State Trials.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>In 1776, there was a case, entitled “A Negro and
a Negress who claimed their liberty against a Jew,”<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
where, after elaborate hearing, the Admiralty decreed
the liberty of the claimants. Here also, while insisting
upon failure to comply with the prescribed formalities,
the original rule of France was eloquently
declared. The counsel of the slaves began by saying: “Two
slaves have had the happiness to land in
France; they have heard that the air breathed here
is that of Liberty.” Proceeding in his argument, the
counsel refutes the Dred Scott decision.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span> “Those,”
said he, “who have thought to perceive a natural imprint
of servitude on the countenances of certain people,
instead of consulting reason, have taken for guide
only the prejudices engendered by vanity and pride.
Had they listened in silence to the powerful voice
which cries at the bottom of the heart of all men,
their own heart would have contradicted the error
of the mind. They would then have recognized that
daring to pretend that all men are not born free is to
calumniate Nature.”<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>In these cases there was an evident disposition to
follow the teachings of Justice and Humanity. In another
case, finally decided in 1759, it was suggested,
that, even where the prescribed formalities had been
complied with, the great rule of Liberty was not restricted,
inasmuch as the Code Noir had never been
registered in the Parliament of Paris. On appeal to
this Parliament, the highest tribunal of France, the
slave was ordered to be set free; upon which counsel,
quoting the case, observed: “This decree attests that
the jurisprudence of the Parliament of Paris is favorable
to Liberty.”<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus far I have adduced only the jurisprudence of
France. But French literature also cries out. The famous
Encyclopædia, edited by those leaders of thought,
Diderot and D’Alembert, in the middle of the last century,
says at the end of an elaborate article on Slavery:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
“We conclude that Slavery, founded by force, by violence,
and in certain climates by excess of servitude,
cannot perpetuate itself in the universe but by the
same means.”<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> Almost contemporaneously, Montesquieu,
in his “Spirit of Laws,” exposed with admirable
irony the wrongs of the African. “It is impossible,”
says the philosopher, “that we should suppose that
these people are men; because, if we supposed them
men, people would begin to think that we ourselves
were not Christians.”<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>No Abolitionist of our day has denounced Slavery
with more power, or vindicated the rights of the African
with more sympathy, than Condorcet. In his
notes to the “<i>Pensées</i>” of Pascal, which appeared in
1776, and gave such satisfaction to Voltaire, he steps
aside to declare:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And let it not be said, that, in suppressing Slavery,
Government would violate the property of the colonists.
How could usage, or even a positive law, ever give a man
a true right of property in the labor, in the liberty, in the
entire being of another innocent man who had never consented
to it? In declaring the negroes free, we should not
take from the colonist his property,&mdash;we should prevent
him from committing a crime; and the money paid for a
crime has never given the right to commit it.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then, in reply to those who charge the negroes with
vices, he says indignantly:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Make them free, and nearer Nature than yourselves,
they will be superior to you.”<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

</div>

<p>So does the French philosopher testify against the
Chief Justice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>Strange that the Chief Justice, forgetting the jurisprudence
and literature of France, forgot also the
brilliant testimony of Lafayette, who, communicating
to Congress at Philadelphia the great news that the
Treaty with England acknowledging our Independence
was signed, wrote by the same packet, and under the
same date, February 5, 1783,<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> to Washington, calling
upon the commander of our armies to unite with him
in the purchase of a small property, where they might
make the experiment of emancipating the negroes, and
of employing them simply as farm laborers. Although
Washington failed to unite with his French friend, the
appeal exists as testimony against the Chief Justice.
There is also the letter of Lafayette to Hamilton, April
13, 1785, asking to be enrolled in what he calls the
“Association against the Slavery of Negroes,” in New
York, and declaring that he has ever been “partial to
his brethren of that color.”<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> This should have been
remembered by the Chief Justice.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From France I pass to Holland, including Belgium.
Here an authority so familiar as Bynkershoek tells us
that the Belgians, capturing Algerines, Tunisians, and
Tripolitans, on the ocean or in the Mediterranean, are
accustomed to sell them into Slavery in Spain; “for
the Belgians themselves have no slaves except in Asia,
Africa, and America.”<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> Like France, the country at
home was free, and Slavery was exiled to the colonies.
The efficacy of this rule is curiously attested
by an incident recorded by Diderot, the Frenchman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
so eminent in science and literature, and of universal
knowledge. It is in his Tour in Holland, made
in 1773. It is well known that Peter of Russia,
called the Great, served as a shipwright in the docks
of Holland. Afterwards visiting the country as Czar,
he was attracted by the apparatus for execution, but,
not comprehending its operation clearly, he said, “It
is only necessary to take one of my slaves, and try it
on him.” It was represented, that, besides the revolting
atrocity of this act, it would not be possible to
allow it. “Ah! why not?” said the Czar. “Am I not
master of my slave, and can I not dispose of him at my
will?” “In your own country, perhaps,” replied the
burgomaster, “but not here. Every slave who sets
foot in Holland becomes free there, and belongs only
to himself.”<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> This visit of the Czar was early in the
last century, though recorded by Diderot later, and then
Holland was already ranged with countries that would
not tolerate Slavery; but the Chief Justice remembers
not the testimony.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Spain also cries out against the Chief Justice. Her
favorite monarch, Isabella, was aroused against the discoverer
of the New World at the report that slaves
from the Indies had been introduced into Spain with
his sanction, and she exclaimed, “By what authority
does Columbus venture thus to dispose of my subjects?”
Instant proclamation was made by her order, that all
who had Indian slaves in their possession, granted by
the Admiral, should forthwith provide for their return
to their own country, while the few held by the Crown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
were restored to freedom in like manner. Las Casas
records, that, “so great was the Queen’s indignation at
the Admiral’s misconduct in this particular, that nothing
but the consideration of his great public services
saved him from immediate disgrace.”<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> Whatever the
legislation and jurisprudence of Spain, this historic incident
must not be forgotten. It was the voice of
the sovereign, and therefore, for the time, the voice of
the nation.</p>

<p>There are other eminent Spaniards to be included
in the cloud of witnesses, especially Las Casas, whose
story I give on the authority of our own historian,
just quoted, whose works were in every library of
the country when the Chief Justice launched his decree:
I mean my much valued friend, the late William
H. Prescott. In his “History of the Conquest of Mexico”
is a description of the good Bishop, who, to relieve
the Indian natives from slavery in the islands
of the West Indies, proposed the introduction of Africans,
and in an evil hour his advice was followed.
At a later period he regretted keenly the wrong he
had done, since, to use his own words, “the same law
applies equally to the Negro and the Indian.” Afterwards,
at a hearing before the Emperor, Charles the
Fifth, he denounced Slavery in words of fervid eloquence,
worthy of any Abolitionist, saying:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> “The
Christian religion is equal in its operation, and is
accommodated to every nation on the globe. It robs
no one of his freedom, violates none of his inherent
rights, on the ground that he is a slave by nature, as
pretended; and it well becomes your Majesty to banish
so monstrous an oppression from your kingdoms in the
beginning of your reign, that the Almighty may make
it long and glorious.”<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> In an elaborate memorial prepared
in 1542, the same upright churchman denounces
Slavery, saying, “God forbids us to do evil that good
may come of it”; and the historian adds, “The whole
argument, which comprehends the sum of what has
been since said more diffusely in defence of Abolition,
is singularly acute and cogent.”<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> But the Chief Justice
forgot all these things.</p>

<p>And he forgot also the dying testimony of Cortés, the
conqueror of Mexico, who, in his testament, revealed
his anxieties as a slave-master, in the following direction
to his son: “It has long been a question, whether
one can conscientiously hold property in Indian slaves.
Since this point has not yet been determined, I enjoin
it on my son Martin and his heirs, that they spare no
pains to come to an exact knowledge of the truth, as a
matter which deeply concerns the conscience of each of
them, no less than mine.” The historian from whom
I copy this passage adds: “The state of opinion in respect
to the great question of Slavery in the sixteenth
century, at the commencement of the system, bears
some resemblance to that which exists in our time,
when we may hope it is approaching its conclusion.
Las Casas and the Dominicans of the former age, the
Abolitionists of their day, thundered out their uncompromising
invectives against the system, on the broad
ground of natural equity and the rights of man.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
Thus in advance did the historian answer the Chief
Justice.</p>

<p>Associated with Las Casas in lofty truth was the
Dominican, Dominic Soto, the confessor of Charles the
Fifth, and the oracle of the Council of Trent, to whom,
it is said, that assembly was indebted for much of the
precision, and even elegance, recognized in its doctrinal
decrees. His Treatise on Justice and Law is not unknown
to students of philosophy, and it has been commended
by Sir James Mackintosh, who rejoices in
bringing forward the remarkable testimony it furnishes
against Slavery. “It is affirmed,” says the Dominican,
“that the unhappy Ethiopians are by fraud or
force carried away and sold as slaves. If this is true,
neither those who have taken them, nor those who purchased
them, nor those who hold them in bondage can
ever have a quiet conscience, till they emancipate them,
<i>even if no compensation should be obtained</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> This testimony
has not been left to slumber in the Latin text of
the author. I take it from a favorite production in our
own language. Not content with quoting it, Mackintosh
adds: “As the work which contains this memorable
condemnation of Man-Stealing and Slavery was the
substance of lectures for many years delivered at Salamanca,
Philosophy and Religion appear, by the hand of
their faithful minister, to have thus smitten the monsters
in their earliest infancy.”<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> But the Chief Justice
ignored all this.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Nor is Portugal to be omitted in this catalogue; and
here the testimony is from a familiar authority, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
none other than the History of Brazil, by Robert
Southey. In this elaborate work, the author, an English
classic of the present century, dwells on the unsurpassed
eloquence of the Father Vieyra, in the early
settlement of Brazil, while he denounced Slavery.
No modern Abolitionist has ever used stronger language.
Born at Lisbon, in 1608, and dying at Bahia,
in 1697, he was called by his countrymen “the last
of the mediæval preachers,” and is the most celebrated
of Portuguese divines. Thus he spoke: “Oh, what
a market! a negro for a soul, and the soul the blacker
of the two! ‘This negro shall be your slave for
the few days that you may have to live, and your
soul shall be my slave through all eternity, as long
as God is God!’&mdash;this is the bargain which the Devil
makes with you.” Then again the fierce orator said:
“My brethren, if there be any who doubt upon this
matter, here are the laws, here are the lawyers; let
the question be asked.… Go to Turkey, go to
Hell: for there can neither be Turk so beturked in
Turkey, nor Devil so bedevilled in Hell, as to affirm
that a free man may be a slave.… We ought to
support ourselves with our own hands; for better is
it to be supported by the sweat of one’s own brow
than by another’s blood. O ye riches of Maranham!
What if these mantles and cloaks were to be wrung?
They would drop blood!”<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Surely here is testimony
worthy of memory; but our Chief Justice knew it
not.</p>

<p>Nor has he regarded official acts by which Portugal
at an early day set herself against Slavery. The years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
1570, 1587, 1595, 1661, and 1680 were marked by
Portuguese to secure the liberty of native Indians.
At a later day, but anterior to our Constitution, the
African began to feel the same recognition. On the
19th September, 1761, it was enacted, that “all black
slaves who should henceforward come to the ports of
the kingdom of Portugal and Algarve from Africa or
America should be free”; and this was followed by
royal order of the 2d January, 1767, extending “this
beneficent measure to mulattoes of both sexes who
were not mentioned in preceding laws.” Then came
the law of 16th January, 1773, which determined that
“the children of male and female slaves, who might be
born in the kingdom of Portugal after the above date,
should be free, and <i>capable of holding office, honors, and
dignities</i>, without the stigma of freedmen, which the
superstition of the Romans established in their customs,
and which Christian union and civil society now
render intolerable in the kingdom.” These important
facts I have from the Portuguese Legation at Washington.
Note, if you please, the dates; yet the Chief
Justice knew nothing of this important and honorable
testimony.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The evidence may well be closed with Italy and
the Catholic Church. Surely Bancroft’s History of
the United States should have taught the Chief Justice
at least to hesitate. In his learned chapter on
Slavery the historian records, that, “by the Venetian
law, no slave might enter a Venetian ship, and to
tread the deck of an argosy of Venice became the
privilege and the evidence of freedom.” Then, again,
the Chief Justice might have learned from him, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
in the twelfth century Pope Alexander the Third became
the guardian of the oppressed, and wrote: “But
since Nature created all free, no one by condition of
Nature was subjected to slavery”; and he might have
learned also how even Pope Leo the Tenth, in the
midst of his luxurious life, making his pontificate a
carnival, declared that “not the Christian religion only,
but Nature herself, cries out against the state of
Slavery.”<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But how could our Chief Justice, belonging and
faithful to the Roman Church, forget the testimony
of that Church as presented by Balmés, the remarkable
Spanish writer, in his work entitled “Protestantism
and Catholicity compared in their Effects on the
Civilization of Europe”? Here is found an eloquent
vindication of the Church, which, according to its defender,
rejected the assumptions of the Chief Justice.
The famous bull against the slave-trade by Gregory
the Sixteenth, in 1839, sets forth what was done to
this end by Paul the Third in 1537, by Urban the
Eighth in 1639, and by Benedict the Fourteenth in
1741, casting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span> “the most severe censures upon those
who venture to reduce the inhabitants of the East or
West Indies into slavery, buy, sell, give, or exchange
them, separate them from their wives and children,
strip them of their property, take or send them into
strange places, or deprive them of their liberty in
any way, to retain them in slavery, or aid, counsel,
succor, or favor those who do these things under any
color or pretence whatever, or preach or teach that
this is lawful, and, in fine, coöperate therewith in any
way whatever.”<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> But, in face of this arraignment
by successive pontiffs, where is the Chief Justice?
Thus does his own Church testify against him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here I suspend the testimony, leaving several famous
countries unvisited. But there is enough for
conviction; nor is argument needed. The witnesses
are before you, excellent and unanswerable, in long
array,&mdash;witnesses from our own country, witnesses
from England, witnesses from Scotland, witnesses from
France, witnesses from Holland, witnesses from Spain,
witnesses from Portugal, witnesses from Italy, witnesses
from the Catholic Church, all rising up to testify
against that “opinion” which the Chief Justice
announces as “fixed and universal in the civilized
portion of the white race,”&mdash;against that “axiom in
morals as well as in politics” which he says “no one
thought of disputing, or supposed to be open to dispute.”
They rejected his “opinion”; they disputed his
“axiom.” Did he forget? or, for the sake of Slavery,
did he pervert judgment? But such forgetfulness
was akin to such perversion. And when it is
considered that this was to put Slavery in the National
Constitution, it was nothing less than a criminal
falsification; nor should ignorance be an excuse.</p>

<p>Plainly, the Chief Justice who could do this deserves
no marble bust by vote of Congress. His comprehensive
office was Justice; his special duty was
Liberty. But these he sacrificed, making Law and
Constitution hideous. The old maxim of Law cries
out against him: <i>Impius et crudelis judicandus est,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
qui Libertati non favet.</i> Such is the terrible judgment.
Again the Law speaks: <i>Execrandus est, qui
Libertati non favet</i>: “Accursed is he who does not
favor Liberty.” This is the ancient voice of the Law,
older than Constitution and Declaration of Independence,
which must not be disobeyed.</p>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Remarks in the Senate, on the Resolution recognizing the
new State Government of Louisiana, February 24, 25, and
27, 1865.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>February 18th, Mr. Trumbull, of Illinois, Chairman of the Committee
on the Judiciary, reported the following resolution, which, at
the request of Mr. Sumner, was read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved, &amp;c.</i>, That the United States do hereby recognize the Government
of the State of Louisiana, inaugurated under and by the Convention
which assembled on the 6th day of April, A. D. 1864, at the city
of New Orleans, as the legitimate Government of the said State, and entitled
to the guaranties and all other rights of a State Government under the
Constitution of the United States.”</p>

</div>

<p>The admission of the State, as here proposed, had the favor of President
Lincoln. It was earnestly opposed by Mr. Sumner, as not republican
in origin or form, and furnishing no security for the rights of colored
persons.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>February 23d, on motion of Mr. Trumbull, the Senate proceeded to
consider the resolution, when Mr. Sumner moved the following substitute:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That neither the people nor the Legislature of any State, the people of
which were declared to be in insurrection against the United States by the
Proclamation of the President, dated August 16, 1861, shall hereafter elect
Representatives or Senators to the Congress of the United States, until the
President, by proclamation, shall have declared that armed hostility to the
Government of the United States within such State has ceased, nor until
the people of such State shall have adopted a Constitution of Government
not repugnant to the Constitution and laws of the United States, nor until,
by a law of Congress, such State shall have been declared to be entitled to
representation in the Congress of the United States of America.”</p>

</div>

<p>This was lost,&mdash;Yeas 8, Nays 29.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>February 24th, Mr. Lane, of Kansas, moved that the resolution be
made the special order for the next day at one o’clock. In the debate
on this motion the following colloquy occurred.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> If we are to make any special order for to-morrow, I think
it should be the bill which the Senate has most maturely considered, and on
which it is most prepared to vote, known as the Railroad Bill, in charge of
my friend from Michigan [Mr. <span class="smcap">Chandler</span>]. The Senator from Illinois [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Trumbull</span>] came forward with his measure&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Conness.</span> Will my friend permit me&mdash;I know he will&mdash;to appeal
to him not to waste the fifteen minutes we have left in discussing the order
of business, but let us take a vote?…</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Several Senators</span> (to Mr. <span class="smcap">Sumner</span>). Give up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Senators say, “Give up.” That is not my habit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Conness.</span> We know that. [<i>Laughter.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Lane</span> (of Kansas). Will the Senator from Massachusetts permit me
to withdraw my motion?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> If the motion is withdrawn, I have nothing further to say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Lane.</span> I withdraw the motion.</p>

</div>

<p>The motion to postpone was not pressed, and the resolution came up
in regular order. After an elaborate speech against it by Mr. Powell,
of Kentucky, Mr. Howard, of Michigan, obtained the floor, when his
colleague, Mr. Chandler, moved to proceed with the bill to regulate
commerce among the States, known as the Railroad Bill. In the debate
that ensued, Mr. Sumner spoke of the latter bill as “a reality,” and
called the resolution “a shadow.” Mr. Doolittle, of Wisconsin, vindicated
the resolution as “the great measure of this Congress,” and said,
“It is not for the Senator from Massachusetts, with all his boastful
friendship for Freedom and free States, to join hands with the Senator
from Kentucky, and undertake to prevent the recognition of the
free State of Louisiana.” In reply, Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">This measure, I say, Sir, is a shadow. So far as
it is calculated to exercise any influence, it is to
bring disaster. Sir, I do not stand here as a prophet,
and I will not at this moment, on this incidental question,
be carried into debate; but I warn the Senator
from Wisconsin, as he loves Human Freedom, ay, Sir,
as he represents a State dedicated to Freedom, to hesitate,
before he throws his influence on the side of such
a proposition, opening the way to an ominous future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir, I am not disposed to go on, and yet there is one
other remark of the Senator to which I must reply.
The Senator insists constantly upon foisting an unconstitutional
idea in the way of establishing Emancipation
throughout this country. He says the vote of Louisiana
is needed to the Constitutional Amendment. Sir,
the vote of Louisiana is not needed; and when the Senator
makes the assertion, he interposes an obstacle to the
Amendment. Is he a friend to it? Why, then, interpose
an obstacle by an untenable and erroneous interpretation
of the Constitution? The Constitution declares
that an Amendment shall become to all intents
and purposes a part of the Constitution, when ratified
by the Legislatures of three fourths of the States.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Doolittle.</span> “When ratified by the Legislatures of
three fourths of the several States.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Very well,&mdash;“when ratified by the Legislatures
of three fourths of the several States”; but if
no Legislatures exist in States, will the Senator make
that an excuse for avoiding the establishment of the
Amendment? I will not recognize the Rebellion to
such extent; I will not recognize the independence of
the Rebel States, as the Senator does. I insist, Sir, that
these States shall not control the National Government
at this moment, in this great period of our history, and
thwart the establishment of human freedom throughout
the land.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>After remarks from other Senators, the motion to take up the Railroad
Bill was lost,&mdash;Yeas 10, Nays 25. Mr. Henderson, of Missouri,
made an elaborate speech in favor of the admission, claiming that its
Constitution was republican in form, in the course of which the following
colloquy occurred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Henderson.</span> The Senator from Kentucky thinks the Constitution of
Louisiana is the offspring of military usurpation, but he does not say that
the Constitution itself is antirepublican.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Henderson.</span> You do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Henderson.</span> In what particular? Mr. President, I have been in
the Senate for nearly four years, and I believe now candidly that the Rebellion
is about at an end, and, if there were no other evidence of it, that
evidence would be presented to-night in the close alliance and affiliation of
my friend from Massachusetts and my friend from Kentucky. Truly, the
lion and the lamb have lain down together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Johnson</span> (of Maryland). Who is the lion, and who is the lamb?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Henderson.</span> That is for the gentlemen themselves to settle.
[<i>Laughter.</i>] The Senator from Massachusetts says that these State Constitutions
are not republican in form. Will he tell me in what respect?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Because they do not follow out the principles of the Constitution
of the United States.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Henderson.</span> I should like to know in what particular. The answer
is a very general one, indeed. He refuses, then, to specify. The Senator
can answer more particularly hereafter, if he chooses. He says these
Constitutions do not follow the Constitution of the United States. I have
looked over them, and I find no objection to them.… The Senator from
Massachusetts says the act of secession took the States out. In the name of
sense, cannot the act of the loyal men bring them back?…</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Does the Senator refer to me as having ever said that the
act of secession took a State out?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Henderson.</span> I understand the Senator to claim that these States
are in a territorial condition,&mdash;that they are not States,&mdash;that, by losing
their State Governments in the act of secession, they lose their specific identity
as States.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I would rather the Senator should use my language than
his own, when he undertakes to state my position. I have never said that
any act of secession took a State out. I have always said just the contrary.
No act of secession can take a State out of this Union. Whatever may be
attempted, the State continues under the Constitution of the United States,
subject to all its requirements and behests. The Government of the State is
subverted by secession; the Senator does not recognize the existing Government
as legal or constitutional, any more than I do. Where, then, is
the difference between us? There is no Government which he or I recognize;
but we do hold that the whole region, the whole territory, is under
the Constitution, to be protected and governed by it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Henderson.</span> The Senator, then, admits that the States are in the
Union. Now I ask him if we can restore the Union without restoring State
Governments in the seceded States.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> That is the desire I have most at heart. I wish to restore
State Governments in those States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Henderson.</span> Then I desire to ask the Senator, if the loyal men in
one of those States acquiesce in the Constitution presented here, are they
not entitled to govern the State under it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> <i>If the loyal men, white and black, recognize it, then it will
be republican in form. Unless that is done, it will not be.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Henderson.</span> Now, Mr. President, I desire to ask the Senator if the
Congress of the United States can interfere with the right of suffrage in one
of the American States of this Union. I put the question to him as a constitutional
lawyer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I answer at once, as a constitutional lawyer, that at the
present time, under the words of the Constitution of the United States, declaring
that the United States shall guaranty to every State a republican
form of government, it is the bounden duty of the United States by Act of
Congress to guaranty complete freedom to every citizen, immunity from all
oppression, and absolute equality before the law. No Government failing to
guaranty these things can be recognized as republican in form, when the
United States are called to enforce the constitutional guaranty.</p>

</div>

<p>In the course of the speech of Mr. Henderson, this further colloquy
occurred.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Henderson.</span> To secure national supremacy, you must have the aid
of State authority. For legitimate State authority you must rely upon the
<i>loyal voters</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> <i>There is where I agree precisely with the Senator; and I
should like to hold him to it.</i> He says the loyal men must form the Government,
and we should recognize that Government; and yet he insists upon a
mere oligarchy forming it, and an oligarchy of the skin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Henderson.</span> The Senator says he agrees with me in my position,
but insists that I am in favor of an oligarchy. If I am in favor of an oligarchy,
and he agrees with me, then he also wants an oligarchy. [<i>Laughter.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> The Senator plays upon words.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Henderson continued at length, answering various objections
to the Louisiana State Government on account of irregularity in the
proceedings. Upon his statement that the failure of the Rebels to
vote did not harm the great principles of Republicanism, the following
passage occurred.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> It was the failure of loyal citizens to vote that did the
damage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Henderson.</span> I answer that by asking, What loyal men did General
Banks prevent from voting?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> <i>All the colored race.</i></p>

</div>

<p>At a late hour Mr. Henderson concluded, and the Senate adjourned.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>February 25th, the Senate proceeded with the resolution, when Mr.
Sumner sent to the Chair resolutions which he proposed to offer as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
substitute, declaring the duty of the States to guaranty republican
governments in the Rebel States on the basis of the Declaration of Independence,&mdash;being
the next article in this volume.</p>

<p>Mr. Howard, of Michigan, made an elaborate speech against the
resolution, and Mr. Reverdy Johnson, of Maryland, for it. The latter
asked: “Are these States to be governed as provinces? That is the
idea of the honorable member from Massachusetts.… Will the honorable
member deny that it would be in the power of Massachusetts
now to exclude the black? I suppose not; and yet, if by an Act of
Congress you place it out of the power of the seceded States, when
they come back, under the authority of that Act, to change the qualifications
of electors, they will not come back as the equals of Massachusetts.”
Then ensued a colloquy.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Allow me to ask the Senator, whether, in his opinion, the
Ordinance governing the Northwest Territory, prohibiting Slavery, and
declared to be a perpetual compact, could be set aside by any one of the
States formed out of the Territory now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Johnson.</span> I certainly think they can, except so far as rights are
vested.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> The Senator, then, thinks Ohio can enslave a fellow-man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Johnson.</span> Just as much as Massachusetts can.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Massachusetts cannot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Johnson.</span> Why not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Massachusetts cannot do an act of injustice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Johnson.</span> Oh, indeed! I did not know that. [<i>Laughter.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> The Senator ought to know it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Johnson.</span> I do not think that is in the Constitution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I beg the Senator’s pardon; it is in the Constitution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Johnson.</span> The United States Constitution, or your State Constitution?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Yes, Sir,&mdash;in our State Constitution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Johnson.</span> But it is not in the constitution of your people. You
sometimes do, or have done, acts of injustice. What I mean to say is this,&mdash;and
I am sure the honorable member will not be able successfully to controvert
it, certainly not by authority,&mdash;that there is no difference between
the State of Massachusetts and any other State in the Union with reference
to its State powers. That is what I mean to say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I mean to say that the State of Massachusetts has no
power to do an act of wrong,&mdash;no power constitutionally, morally, politically,
or in any way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Johnson.</span> What is an act of wrong? Who is to judge of it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> To enslave a fellow-man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Johnson.</span> You had them there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Not since the Constitution.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>Afterwards came the following question and answer.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Does the Senator from Maryland, who now calls in question
the validity of the Proclamation of Emancipation, question that the Supreme
Court of the United States, with its present Chief Justice, would affirm
the complete validity of that Proclamation everywhere within the Rebel
States strictly according to its letter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Johnson.</span> If I am perfectly satisfied, as I am, that the Chief Justice
is abundantly capable of filling the high office he has, I do not think he
would; but whether he would or not does not settle the question, what the
Court would do. He is but one of ten.</p>

</div>

<p>At the close of Mr. Johnson’s speech, Mr. Sumner offered the following
proviso, to come at the end of the resolution:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Provided</i>, That this shall not take effect, except upon the fundamental
condition that within the State there shall be no denial of the electoral franchise,
or of any other rights, on account of color or race, but all persons
shall be equal before the law. And the Legislature of the State, by a solemn
public act, shall declare the assent of the State to this fundamental
condition, and shall transmit to the President of the United States an authentic
copy of such assent, whenever the same shall be adopted; upon the
receipt whereof, he shall, by proclamation, announce the fact; whereupon,
without any further proceedings on the part of Congress, this joint resolution
shall take effect.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner remarked, that he desired to call attention to the precedent
on which this proviso was modelled, and he was induced to do
so from the very elaborate way in which Mr. Johnson had seemed to
anticipate it. He has announced that it would be futile; but those
who preceded us did not think so; and Mr. Sumner then read the resolution
for the admission of Missouri into the Union on a certain condition,
where is a proviso, as he insisted, similar in character.</p>

<p>Mr. Henderson moved to amend the proviso by inserting after the
word “race” the words “or sex.” Meanwhile occurred a desultory
debate, in which the proviso was opposed by Mr. Henderson and
Mr. Johnson,&mdash;also by Mr. Pomeroy, of Kansas. The latter said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
“I usually vote for everything that the Senator from Massachusetts
brings forward on the Antislavery question; but I am opposed to this
amendment,&mdash;in the first place, because I do not suppose that we have
the right to say what shall be the qualifications of voters in any State
in the Union.… I shall vote against all amendments that look like
dictation on the part of Congress to any State, whether they will let
the right of suffrage be enjoyed by a whole or a part of the people.”</p>

<p>After some time, Mr. Wade, of Ohio, remarked, that it had “got
now to be pretty late in the evening,” and he moved that the resolution
be postponed till the first Monday in December next. While
this was pending, Mr. Wilson, of Massachusetts, moved an adjournment,
which was lost,&mdash;Yeas 11, Nays not counted. After debate,
the question was put on the motion of Mr. Wade, which was lost,&mdash;Yeas
12, Nays 17. Mr. Howard, of Michigan, then moved an adjournment,
which was lost,&mdash;Yeas 12, Nays 19. Mr. Howard then
moved that the whole subject be laid on the table, which was lost,&mdash;Yeas
12, Nays 18.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I agree with the Senator from Michigan
in the impropriety of pressing a measure of this
importance. Perhaps it is the most important measure
we have had before us. I shall regard its passage as a
national calamity. It will be the political Bull Run of
this Administration, sacrificing a great cause and the
great destinies of the Republic. I will not go into debate
at this time. I think the Senate is not in a condition
to vote finally upon it. There are many who
would unquestionably like to record their names upon
it who are not here. We ought to give them an opportunity.
We ought also to give an opportunity for further
discussion. It never has been the habit of the
Senate, except in those days which we ought not to
imitate,&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Foster</span> (of Connecticut). Will the honorable Senator
allow me to ask him a question?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Foster.</span> I will ask the honorable Senator if he is not
fully prepared to vote on the question.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I certainly am prepared to vote on it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Foster.</span> I will merely say I am.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> … I think, on his account, it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
be well that the question should be postponed for another
day. It is never too late to mend; and it is not
impossible that even the Senator, coming from New
England, representing, as I doubt not he does, liberal
ideas, devoted as he must be to the cause of Human
Freedom and of his country, may think there is something
in this question to justify the most mature consideration,&mdash;something
on which the Senate ought to
deliberate carefully, without rushing precipitately to a
vote. Sir, this question ought not to be closed to-night,
and I therefore move an adjournment; and on that I
ask for the yeas and nays.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The motion was lost,&mdash;Yeas 11, Nays 18.</p>

<p>Mr. Trumbull then appealed for a vote, saying: “The Senator
from Massachusetts has fought it day after day to prevent it coming
up; and when a large majority of the Senate has overruled him time
and again, and decided that it should come up, he stands here, at half
after ten o’clock on Saturday night, making dilatory motions.” He
also protested against what he called “manifestations of a determination
to browbeat the Senate on the part of a minority.” Mr.
Sumner followed.</p>

</div>

<p>The Senator from Illinois draws upon his imagination,
which, on this occasion, is peculiarly lively. I
know not that anybody has undertaken to browbeat.
Certainly nobody on the side with which I am associated
has done any such thing, or, I believe, imagined
doing it.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Trumbull.</span> I heard it said that there should be no
vote to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Well, Sir, is that browbeating?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Trumbull.</span> I think it is undertaking to decide for
the Senate.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Is that browbeating? No, Sir; it is
only undertaking to decide the conduct of an individual
Senator with regard to an important public measure.
The question between the Senator from Illinois
and myself is simply this: he wishes to pass the measure,
and I do not wish to pass it. He thinks the measure
innocent; I think it dangerous, and, thinking it
dangerous, I am justified in opposing it, and in employing
all the means to be found in our arsenal. But,
Sir, I mean to employ them properly and in a parliamentary
way. In no other way can I act in this
Chamber.</p>

<p>The Senator is entirely mistaken, if he supposes that
this measure can be passed to-night. I tell him it cannot.
Parliamentary Law is against him; and the importance
of the question justifies a resort to every instrument
that Parliamentary Law supplies. The Senator
knows it well. I need not even suggest it.</p>

<p>And now, Sir, I have to counsel the Senator,&mdash;perhaps
he would say that I am taking too great a liberty,
and even dictating,&mdash;but I would first advise the Senator
to look at the clock. He will see that on this evening
of Saturday it is twenty-five minutes of eleven,&mdash;that
it is approaching Sunday. Then let him remember
that we have been here all day, and ask himself
whether, all things considered, it is advisable to press
such a revolutionary measure after this protracted session,
and at this late hour. I think his better judgment
will come to the conclusion that it is not. At any rate,
should he not come to that conclusion, I think he will
make a mistake, and all his efforts will be fruitless.
There is a certain character of Antiquity who was found
sowing salt in the sand by the sea-shore, and ploughing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
it in. The Senator will be engaged in an occupation
just about as profitable.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Davis, of Kentucky, then moved a call of the Senate, which
being ruled out of order, as never entertained by the Senate, Mr.
Sumner moved an adjournment, which was lost,&mdash;Yeas 8, Nays 19.
In the desultory debate that ensued, Mr. Doolittle, of Wisconsin, criticized
Mr. Sumner, who replied. Mr. Hendricks, of Indiana, followed,
and, in the course of his remarks, said: “The question is, What is to
be done with the four million negroes, when they are set free? There
are Senators upon the Republican side who feel that it is a very troublesome
question. That is the trouble here to-night.… The Senator
from Massachusetts is determined that none of these States shall
ever be heard in the Halls of Congress, until the men who speak from
those States speak the voice of the negroes as well as of the white
men. Other Senators say that shall not be. We Democrats are a unit
upon that question.” On motion of Mr. Lane, of Kansas, the Senate
adjourned shortly before midnight, leaving the resolution pending.</p>

<p>February 27th, the resolution came up in regular order, when Mr.
Sherman moved to proceed with the Internal Revenue Bill, and then
called attention to the Indian Appropriation Bill, the Civil Appropriation
Bill, the Tariff Bill, also the Army and Navy Appropriation
Bills, all of which must be considered before March 4th, when the
session closed. In the debate that followed, Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;I remember that good fortune last
summer threw me in the path of a distinguished gentleman
just returned from Louisiana. I think he had been
present at the sittings of the Convention whose work
finds such an advocate in my friend from Illinois; at
any rate, he had been in New Orleans at the time, in
the discharge of important public duties. In reply to
an inquiry with regard to that Convention, he said
compendiously, that it was “nothing but a stupendous
hoax,”&mdash;yes, Sir, nothing but a stupendous hoax, and
the product of that Convention&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Here Mr. Sumner was called to order by Mr. Sherman, for discussing
the merits of the measure, when only the order of business was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
question. He was also interrupted by Mr. Grimes, of Iowa, who
said, that, if the Senate would give him a committee, he would show
fraudulent voting.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I doubt not that my friend from Iowa
is right; but I am aware that it is not proper to discuss
the merits of the question on this preliminary
motion, and I shall not. I was simply characterizing it,
and I was going on to say that in my opinion the resolution
the Senator from Illinois so earnestly presses
upon the Senate, when we consider its origin and character,
is itself very little different from “a stupendous
hoax.” I say nothing about the Convention, for I was
not there, I did not see it. On that point I simply
cite the testimony of another. But the resolution of
the Senator is before us; we are familiar with its nature.
Every moment gives new glimpses of the violence
and fraud with which it is associated. Perhaps
the expression I have quoted is hardly grave enough
in speaking of such a matter, where, in forming the
Constitution of a State, military power and injustice to
a whole race have been enlisted in defiance of the self-evident
truths of the Declaration of Independence. The
United States are bound by the Constitution to “guaranty
to every State in this Union a republican form of
government.” Being called to perform this guaranty,
you are asked to recognize an oligarchy of the skin,
and on this very question the Senate is now called to
vote.</p>

<p>The pretended State Government in Louisiana is
utterly indefensible, whether you look at its origin or
its character. To describe it, I must use plain language.
It is a mere seven-month’ abortion, begotten
by the bayonet in criminal conjunction with the spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
of caste, and born before its time, rickety, unformed,
unfinished,&mdash;whose continued existence will be a burden,
a reproach, and a wrong. That is the whole case;
and yet the Senator from Illinois now presses it upon
the Senate, to the exclusion of the important public
business of the country. For instance,&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Here Mr. Sherman insisted on confining the debate to the pending
motion. The vote was then taken, and resulted,&mdash;Yeas 34, Nays 12;
so the resolution for the admission of Louisiana was postponed, never
to be resumed.</p>

<p>During the next Congress, Mr. Sumner urged a bill for the organization
of Louisiana, with safeguards for Equal Rights, including suffrage
without distinction of color; but the Senate was not inclined to consider
it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The failure of the Louisiana resolution attracted attention at the
time. Some journals spoke of Mr. Sumner’s course with severity;
others were rejoiced at the result. The New York <i>Herald</i> said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The factious opposition of Mr. Sumner has probably defeated the recognition
of the new government of Louisiana by the Senate at the present session,
… although probably two thirds of the Senate are in favor of recognition.”</p>

</div>

<p>One journal said, in figurative language, that Mr. Sumner had “kicked
the pet scheme of the President down the marble steps of the Senate
Chamber,” and that, as a consequence, the intimate relations which he
had sustained with the President must cease.</p>

<p>President Lincoln was too good a man to be influenced by an honest
opposition on political grounds. A few days later, Mr. Sumner received
from him the following note.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Executive Mansion, Washington</span>, March 5, 1865.</p>

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">Hon. C. Sumner.</span></p>

<p>“My dear Sir,&mdash;I should be pleased for you to accompany us to-morrow
evening, at ten o’clock, on a visit of half an hour to the Inaugural Ball.
I enclose a ticket. Our carriage will call for you at half past nine.</p>

<p class="sig">“Yours truly,</p>

<p class="sig2">“<span class="smcap">A. Lincoln</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>At the appointed time the carriage was at Mr. Sumner’s lodgings.
During the ball he was with the Presidential party, which gave occasion
to comment; the New York <i>Herald</i> remarking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span> “It was presumed that
the President had indorsed his Reconstruction theories.” There is reason
to believe that he had not; but he recognized the right of Mr.
Sumner to his own individual judgment.</p>

<p>The following extract from the letter of a newspaper correspondent
at Washington illustrates the course of the President towards Mr.
Sumner.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mrs. Lincoln went down the Potomac this morning for City Point and
Richmond, escorted by Mr. Sumner, who remains in Washington to exert
his influence in the right direction in closing up the war. Nor let any man
suppose that Mr. Sumner’s influence is slight over this Administration, when
Congress is in session. I know of no man who has more. The President
disagrees entirely with Mr. Sumner in his views respecting Reconstruction.
He was almost indignant at the Senator’s course towards Louisiana, adverting
to it over and over again in the presence of strangers. But still he respects
Mr. Sumner, confers with him, and perhaps fears him. Besides, the
Senator has great influence with Mr. Stanton and Mr. Welles. Mr. Sumner
is a clever diplomatist, and has always been friendly with Mr. Lincoln. So
long as ‘peace negotiations’ are talked of, Mr. Sumner will not leave Washington
but for a day or two, I presume.”</p>

</div>

<p>The effort of Mr. Sumner on the Louisiana question found a warm
and cordial response, as amply appears from letters at the time.</p>

<p>Wendell Phillips wrote from Boston:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Though I have but half an hour at home, I cannot let it pass without
thanking you for your gallant fight against Louisiana. Your tireless patience
in carrying in detail one point after another of the enemy’s defences,
all winter long, has not passed without our grateful admiration; the masterly
strategy of the last week is the grand and fitting climax,&mdash;all the
more grateful, because we had been told you felt the resistance so hopeless
as to fear you must succumb to the dictation of the Cabinet. We have
watched your white plume with fearful delight. Could we only hope this
defeat would be final, our joy would be unmixed. At any rate, the effort
will bear fruit thousand-fold.”</p>

you most warmly on your splendid fight and great victory in the Bogus
Louisiana struggle. Some weak-kneed Republicans who rejoice at the result
did not know at first whether to rejoice or not, when they saw what tools
you had to work with; but your true friends, who have their eyes open, are
full of joy, and all the rest will fall into line as soon as the great truth becomes
apparent to them.”</p>

of factious opposition to the Administration and the President; but
there are those who believe your opposition comes from a desire to do justice,

Louisiana is staved off for the present. I have often fervently thanked God
that you were in your present position, and enabled to do so much to prevent
evil and accomplish good,&mdash;but never more earnestly than now. I know
it must be hard to withstand so many of the supporters of the Administration,
but the battle <i>must</i> be fought on the very question involved in this
measure. It will not only be wicked and infamous, but suicidal, for us to
let the greater part of the rank and file of the Rebels come back and be
voters, while we exclude our colored countrymen. I hope strength will
be given to you, according to your day; as to your zeal, courage, ability,

Your efforts are so much the more admirable and important as they
are opposed by mistaken Senators, such as Trumbull and Doolittle, and by
some of our editors, as of the <i>Times</i>. The heart of the country goes with
you, not with your opponents. It would be a terrible disaster to have the
precedent set of a State readmitted to the Union with the sacrifice of the
rights of the blacks. Your resolutions of Saturday, as well as the amendment
you proposed, were admirable. The victory will be worth everything,
if you can carry something of that kind.”</p>

that will take a long time to remedy. When I read in this morning’s

as if a great moral as well as political battle had been won by our side.”</p>

<p>Dr. J. B. Smith, giving expression to the feelings of colored citizens

I feel in my inmost soul towards you for your efforts and final success
in defeating the bill for the readmission of Louisiana as a State into the
Union, with the present flagrantly unjust and proscriptive laws and Constitution.
<i>The white people of this country have been so accustomed to regard
and treat us as their natural inferiors</i>, that we dread the very thought of
submitting to them the adjustment of our rights after their own are made
secure. What is not gained for us now will not be obtained for a quarter of
a century after peace is declared.”</p>

<p>Frederick Douglass, the watchful orator of his race, wrote from
Rochester, New York:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The friends of Freedom all over the country have looked to you, and
confided in you, of all men in the United States Senate, during all this terrible
war. They will look to you all the more, now that peace dawns, and the
final settlement of our national troubles is at hand. God grant you strength
equal to your day and your duties! is my prayer and that of millions.”</p>

</div>

<p>In harmony with these expressions, the following resolution was
adopted unanimously by the Worcester Freedom Club, and communicated
to Mr. Sumner:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the ‘Worcester Freedom Club’ tenders to the Hon.
Charles Sumner their gratitude as freemen, for the able manner in which
he met the question for the admission of Louisiana, and for his noble defence
of the ‘Equality of all men before the Law.’”</p>

</div>

<p>Evidently Mr. Sumner was not alone. The right of colored fellow-citizens
was recognized as next in order for discussion and judgment.

IN THE REBEL STATES.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Resolutions in the Senate, February 25, 1865.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>While the resolution recognizing the existing State government of
Louisiana was under consideration, Mr. Sumner introduced the following
resolutions, which, on his motion, were ordered to be printed. He
gave notice that at the proper time he should move them as a substitute
for the pending resolution. But before the proper time the Louisiana
resolution was postponed, and it fell with the session.</p>

</div>

<p class="blockquote hanging">Resolutions declaring the duty of the United States to
guaranty Republican Governments in the Rebel States,
on the basis of the Declaration of Independence; so that
the new Governments shall be founded on the consent of
the governed, and the Equality of all persons before the
Law.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><i>Resolved</i>, That it is the duty of the United
States, by Act of Congress, at the earliest practicable
moment consistent with the common defence
and the general welfare, to reëstablish republican governments
in those States where loyal governments have
been vacated by the existing Rebellion, and thus, to
the full extent of their power, fulfil the requirement of
the Constitution, that “the United States shall guaranty
to every State in this Union a republican form of
government.”</p>

<p>2. That this important duty is positively imposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
by the Constitution on “the United States,” and not on
individuals or classes of individuals, or on any military
commander or executive officer, and cannot be intrusted
to any such persons, acting, it may be, for an oligarchical
class, and in disregard of large numbers of loyal
people; but it must be performed by the United States,
represented by the President and both Houses of Congress,
acting for the whole people.</p>

<p>3. That, in determining the extent of this duty, and
in the absence of any precise definition of the term
“republican in form,” we cannot err, if, when called to
perform this guaranty, we adopt the self-evident truths
of the Declaration of Independence as an authoritative
rule, and insist that in every reëstablished State the
consent of the governed shall be the only just foundation
of government, and all persons shall be equal before
the law.</p>

<p>4. That, outside the Declaration of Independence,
it is plain that any duty imposed by the Constitution
must be performed in conformity with justice and reason,
and in the light of existing facts; that therefore,
in the performance of this guaranty, there can be no
power under the Constitution to disfranchise loyal people,
or to recognize any such disfranchisement, especially
when it may hand over the loyal majority to the government
of the disloyal minority; nor can there be any
power under the Constitution to discriminate in favor
of the Rebellion by admitting to the electoral franchise
Rebels who have forfeited all rights, and excluding
loyal persons who have never forfeited any right.</p>

<p>5. That the United States, now at a crisis of history
called to perform this guaranty, will fail in duty under
the Constitution, should they allow the reëstablishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
of any State without proper safeguards for the
rights of all the citizens, and especially without making
it impossible for Rebels in arms against the National
Government to trample upon the rights of those
fighting the battles of the Union.</p>

<p>6. That the path of justice is also the path of peace,
and that for the sake of peace it is better to obey the
Constitution, and, in conformity with the guaranty, to
reëstablish State governments on the consent of the
governed, and the equality of all persons before the
law, to the end that the foundations may be permanent,
and that no loyal majorities may be again overthrown
or ruled by any oligarchical class.</p>

<p>7. That a government founded on military power,
or having its origin in military orders, cannot be “republican
in form,” according to the requirement of the
Constitution; and that its recognition will be contrary,
not only to the Constitution, but also to that essential
principle of our Government which, in the language of
Jefferson, establishes “the supremacy of the civil over
the military authority.”<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>8. That, in the States whose governments have already
been vacated, a government founded on an oligarchical
class, even if erroneously recognized as “republican
in form” under the guaranty of the Constitution,
cannot sustain itself securely without national
support; that such an oligarchical government is not
competent at this moment to discharge the duties and
execute the powers of a State; and that its recognition
as a legitimate government will tend to enfeeble the
Union, to postpone the day of reconciliation, and to
endanger the national tranquillity.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>
<p>9. That considerations of expediency are in harmony
with the requirements of the Constitution and the dictates
of justice and reason, especially now, when colored
soldiers have shown their military value; that, as their
muskets are needed for the national defence against
Rebels in the field, so are their ballots yet more needed
against the subtle enemies of the Union at home; and
that without their support at the ballot-box the cause
of human rights and of the Union itself will be in constant
peril.</p>

OVER FELLOW-CITIZENS.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Remarks in the Senate, on Joint Resolution authorizing a
Contract with William H. Powell, February 27, 1865.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>February 27th, the Senate having under consideration a joint resolution
from the House of Representatives, authorizing a contract with
William H. Powell for a picture at the Capitol, not to exceed twenty-five
thousand dollars in amount, Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I am sorry that my friend
from Vermont [Mr. <span class="smcap">Collamer</span>] feels obliged to
press this proposition. I do not like to vote against it.
Still more, I am reluctant to speak against it. But,
satisfied as I am, after careful reflection, that it ought
not to pass, I shall express briefly the grounds of my
opposition. When it was called up the other day, I
ventured to say that I did not think this the time for
us to enter upon the patronage of art. Of course such
patronage is beautiful and most tempting. It may
seem ungracious to arrest it; but I submit confidently,
that at this moment, with the national debt accumulating
at the rate of millions a day, with brave soldiers
still unpaid, with a drain upon our resources at
every point, it is not advisable to enter upon the patronage
of art, beautiful and most tempting as it is.</p>

<p>There is much to be done to complete the National
Capitol in all its parts. Let the work proceed, until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
the sublime structure stands forth worthy in everything
of the destinies it enshrines. But I think we
may hesitate at this time to enter upon any ornamentation
not essential to the work. If you order one costly
picture, you will be called to order another; and where
will this expenditure stop? Better wait for the days of
peace, soon to come, I trust, when your means will be
greater, and you will approach the question in a calmer
mood.</p>

<p>Thus far I have said nothing of the artist. But
the vote proposed selects one artist for especial honor,
and leaves all others unnoticed. It is like a vote of
thanks to an officer in the army or navy. Are the
merits of this artist so peculiar and commanding that
he should be taken and all others left? I doubt. At
least, I know that there are other artists in the country
who deserve well of those who assume the patronage of
art. Are you ready, in this off-hand way, without inquiry,
without even hearing their names, to discriminate
against them all? I put these questions in no
spirit of criticism, and certainly in no unkindness to
the artist, for whom, let me say, I have a sincere regard.
There is already one picture by him in the Capitol.
A second would be more than enough.</p>

<p>Then, again, are you sure that the subject selected
at the present time would be such as a maturer and
more chastened taste could approve? This is a period
of war. We are all under its influence. But I doubt
if it be desirable to keep before us any picture of
war, especially of a war with fellow-citizens. There
are moral triumphs to which art may better lend its
charms. I need only refer to the Proclamation of Emancipation,
which belongs to the great events of history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>I send to the Chair an amendment, to come in at the
end of the resolution:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Provided</i>, That in the National Capitol, dedicated to the
National Union, there shall be no picture of a victory in battle
with our own fellow-citizens.”</p>

</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="medium">

<p>In the debate that ensued, Mr. Wilson, of Massachusetts, said:
“I rise more especially to say that I disagree with my colleague
altogether in the proposition that no work of art shall grace the Capitol
of this country that represents anything of the present war of a
military or naval character. I do not believe in that doctrine.” Mr.
Howe, of Wisconsin, said: “If there were any one proposition which
could make the original resolution more distasteful to me than it is
in itself, it would be the proviso moved by the Senator from Massachusetts.”</p>

<p>February 28th, the amendment of Mr. Sumner was rejected without
a division.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner then offered another:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

artist.”</p>

</div>

<p>This also was lost,&mdash;Yeas 15, Nays 23,&mdash;as also another amendment,
to purchase of F. B. Carpenter his picture of “The Emancipation Proclamation,”

<p>Among those who expressed sympathy with Mr. Sumner on this

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Remarks in the Senate, on an Amendment to the Internal
Revenue Act, making Books free, February 27, 1865.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>February 27th, the Senate had under consideration a bill to amend
the Internal Revenue Act, by striking out of the clause relating to
printed books the word “magazines,” and by inserting after the word
“newspapers” the words “and periodical magazines,” so that it would
read: “On all printed books, pamphlets, reviews, and all other similar
printed books, except newspapers and periodical magazines, a duty
of five per cent ad valorem.” In commenting on this proposition and
another adopted by the House, Mr. Sherman, of Ohio, remarked: “I
almost became a convert to the idea of the Senator from Massachusetts,
and that it would be better to strike out the whole clause, rather than
to attempt to make these discriminations and qualifications and exceptions.”
Mr. Sumner followed.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">I am very glad to hear the Senator from Ohio say
that he had become almost a convert to the idea of
removing all tax on books. He reminded me of a certain
person who was “almost persuaded to be a Christian.”
I think it would be better for the Senator, had
he become a complete convert. I am sure his influence
would be better for the country.</p>

<p>I speak from no motive of self, and from no personal
interest whatever, but from a profound conviction that
for the best interests of the country there should be no
tax on books. What you can extort out of this tax, in
any event, is very small; and it is always a tax on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
knowledge. Look at it as you will, to that complexion
it comes at last. I do not think it worth while for Congress
to adopt such a tax. It is the boast of our institutions
that they stand upon the intelligence of the
people, and it is a further boast that we supply education
for all at the public cost; but books are indispensable
in this benefaction. Every tax upon books, therefore,
is an impediment to that education which is the
pride of our country. Plainly it is inconsistent with
the genius of our institutions. The result of this tax
will be petty, but, to the extent of its influence, prejudicial.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Sumner moved to strike out the whole clause. Then, in reply
to Mr. Clark, of New Hampshire, he remarked:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>The Senator from New Hampshire does not quite
like to tax the Bible. Sir, I do not like to tax it. My
proposition is broader than his; but he knows very
well that the real signification of <i>Bible</i> is <i>book</i>.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Clark.</span> Not in our language.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I do not know about that. The Senator
does plead, however, for the manufacturer of the
shirt, whose shop is by the side of the bookseller; but
the difference between the two cases is, as I have indicated:
that, if you tax the book, you tax knowledge; if
you tax the shirt, you but tax one of the general manufactures
of the country. The distinction may not be
accepted by all; and yet to my mind it is perfectly
clear. You cannot tax a book without taxing knowledge.
But it is said there are books that might very
well be taxed out of existence. Where run the line?
How make the discrimination? The trouble is more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
than it is worth. Better, therefore, have no such tax
than run any such line or make any such discrimination.
A book is a book; and there should be no tax on
a book.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Afterwards, in reply to Mr. Reverdy Johnson, of Maryland, he remarked:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>I have only one word in reply to the learned Senator
from Maryland. He does not regard a tax on books as
a tax on knowledge. Pray, then, what is such a tax?
I can imagine no tax more directly on knowledge. If
the Senator can, I should like to have him indicate it.
Possibly he can. I believe he cannot. If we repair to
the experience of other countries, we find that books are
not taxed. In England, where taxation is carried to the
farthest point, we know that books are not taxed. We
know, also, that, after long and protracted struggle, only
during this last year was the last tax on knowledge overthrown,
being the paper duty. And yet, Sir, Senators
would take up the cast-off taxes of Great Britain, and
do even worse. Great Britain has taxed paper, has imposed
a stamp-tax also on newspapers, all of which have
been latterly removed; but I am not aware that this
taxing nation has imposed a tax upon books. And shall
our Republic, founded on knowledge, whose duty and
mission are to make knowledge cheap, impose, for the
first time, a tax on books?</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Wilson said: “I shall vote against exempting from taxation
any book whatever, even the Bible.… I am against these exemptions.
What, Sir! a tax on books a tax on knowledge? Suppose it is:
so is a tax on the coat the boy who goes to school wears.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner replied:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;My colleague does not see the difference
between a tax on a boy’s clothes and a tax on
his book. The country, in its experience, from the first
settlement at Plymouth Rock, has seen it. Clearly it
saw the difference, when it undertook to say that education
should be at the public cost, free of charge to every
one in the community. My friend [Mr. <span class="smcap">Howe</span>] shakes
his head; he knows well that one of the proudest acts
in the history of New England was when at an early
day she established her system of public schools, which
has continued ever since, where every child is educated
free of charge. He was educated at the public cost, but
not clothed at the public cost. And, Sir, if you would
know what gave to New England those elements of
prosperity and of influence, which are, I think, sometimes
recognized, you will find them in that very education
at the public cost. It was because those early
settlers, founders of communities, saw that the mind
should be clothed, and willingly undertook to clothe it.
The family at home were left to clothe the body. Now
I would have the country act according to this illustrious
precedent, which has done so much for the national
name, and remove every impediment in the path
of knowledge. Do not tell me that by the same rule
you must remove the tax from clothes. The conclusion
does not follow. If our fathers were right in establishing
free schools, it is right for us now to insist
upon free books.</p>

</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>Benjamin G. Smith and Franklin W. Smith, merchants and co-partners
in Boston, with the firm name of Smith Brothers &amp; Co., were
suddenly arrested in June, 1864, by order of the Navy Department,
under the charge of fraud in the performance of contracts with the Department.
They were at once consigned to Fort Warren, in the harbor
of Boston, with strict injunctions to prevent any communication by
them with the outer world. Bail to the amount of half a million dollars
was required, which was subsequently reduced to forty thousand.
Their counting-room was broken open, their safe forced, and their
books seized. Their houses were searched, and private papers taken
away. Their business was, for the time, destroyed. This work was
crowned by ordering a court-martial for the trial of these civilians at
Philadelphia.</p>

<p>These proceedings excited a general interest at Boston. The Massachusetts
delegation in Congress united in the following appeal to the
President, which was drawn by Mr. Sumner.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">To the President of the United States</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="dropcap">The undersigned, Senators and Representatives in
Congress from Massachusetts, ask leave to call
your serious attention to the proceedings initiated by
the Navy Department against Benjamin G. Smith and
Franklin W. Smith, of Boston, of the firm of Smith
Brothers &amp; Co., a much respected firm, which has hitherto
enjoyed the confidence, personal and mercantile, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
the community where they reside. Among their neighbors
and friends these proceedings have already attracted
much attention, and awakened corresponding
feeling.</p>

<p>The proceedings have seemed to be harsh, vindictive,
and unnecessary.</p>

<p>1. In the character of the arrest of Messrs. Smith,
which was attended by circumstances of severity utterly
unjustifiable.</p>

<p>2. In requiring bonds to so large an amount as half
a million of dollars. The fact that the parties in question
easily obtained bonds for a much larger amount
does not render the exaction of “excessive bail” less
obnoxious to the requirements of the Constitution and
of justice, or less indicative of the spirit in which these
proceedings have been conducted.</p>

<p>3. In the seizure of their books and papers, which
are still detained, although regarded by their eminent
counsel as important to their defence.</p>

<p>4. In turning into a military offence what is more
proper for a civil tribunal, and dragging these defendants
before a court-martial.</p>

<p>5. In transferring the proceedings from Boston,
where the parties reside, and the transactions in question
occurred, to Philadelphia: thus increasing greatly
the difficulties and the cost of defence. This will be
appreciated, when it is understood that the witnesses
are very numerous, and chiefly engaged in mercantile
business, so that they cannot leave Boston without
neglect of their private interests.</p>

<p>The undersigned, on reviewing these circumstances,
which are so inconsistent with the administration of
justice in its most ordinary forms, have been at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
loss to account for the spirit manifested in the prosecution.
If they look at the trivial character of many
of the specifications against the defendants, they are
still more at a loss. It is difficult to account for such
elaborate and persistent harshness, without yielding to
the prevailing belief that other motives than the vindication
of justice have entered into this case.</p>

<p>The undersigned are not strangers to the fact, that
one of these defendants, in the discharge of what he
believed to be his duty as a good citizen, has, by correspondence
and testimony before committees of Congress,
been brought into collision with officers of the Navy
Department; and there is too much reason to believe
that some of these officers have allowed themselves
to be governed by personal feelings throughout these
strange proceedings.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances, the undersigned most respectfully
ask your assistance in securing justice to
these defendants, according to the common course of
proceedings at law. They are acquainted with the statute
which provides court-martial for contractors in certain
cases, and they are unwilling to make any suggestion
which shall interfere with its efficiency; but they
have no hesitation in saying that such a statute, intended
for extreme cases, should not be applied to a
case like the present, where, with a single exception,
the questions are simply whether the defendants complied
with their <i>contract</i>, and therefore, from their
nature, can be better considered by the ordinary tribunals
accustomed to such questions than by a naval
tribunal composed of officers who have no familiarity
with them.</p>

<p>If the pending proceedings against the Messrs. Smith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
should be continued, there are two courses with regard
to them which may be recommended.</p>

<p><i>First</i>, That they should be transferred at once to the
United States Court in Massachusetts, and be placed
under the direction of the learned Attorney of the
United States for that District.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, If the foregoing order is not deemed expedient,
on the existing evidence, then a commission or
commissioner might be appointed by the President to
inquire into the circumstances attending the arrest of
the defendants, and also into the nature of the charges
against them, in order to ascertain and report if there
is any sufficient reason for the singular harshness to
which they have been already subjected, and also for
the exceptional proceedings instituted against them.</p>

<p>For the sake of justice, and to relieve the Government
from all suspicion of undue harshness, the undersigned
protest against the spirit in which these proceedings
have been conducted, and appeal to you for such
remedy as shall seem best, to the end that the public
interests may be adequately protected without any sacrifice
of the rights of the citizen, and without needless
interference with the order of business.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The trial proceeded at Charlestown, lasting several months, with
able counsel for the defendants, and it ended in judgment against the
defendants, who were sentenced to imprisonment for two years and
a fine of twenty thousand dollars. This judgment and sentence were
approved by the Secretary of the Navy, and it only remained for the
President to give them his sanction. Before this was done, Mr. Sumner
saw him. The President listened to his appeal, and at once put
into his hands the elaborate report from the Secretary of the Navy,
setting forth the facts in the case and approving the conclusion of the
court-martial,&mdash;asking him to read it carefully and give his opinion
upon it, which he did without delay.</p>

</div>

<h3>OPINION.</h3>

<p>This case has been pending since 17th June, 1864,
when the Messrs. Smith Brothers, who, as merchants,
enjoyed an enviable reputation, were suddenly arrested
by military authority, and, without any opportunity of
conferring with counsel or friends, were hurried off to
Fort Warren. During all this period, running over nine
months, I have kept myself aloof from the case, so far
as possible, knowing that I was not so circumstanced
as to consider it on its merits, and under the conviction,
that, at last, justice would be done.</p>

<p>On certain matters independent of the merits I have
with others been called to speak. One of these was
the manner of the arrest and the bail required. At the
time of the arrest, all the books and papers of the parties
were seized and sequestered. The hardship of the
arrest was aggravated by the bail required, which was
fixed at half a million of dollars. “Excessive bail” is
forbidden by the Constitution; but it would be difficult
to say what bail could be “excessive,” if this was not.</p>

<p>The other matter on which I was called to speak
was the order for the trial of the Messrs. Smith Brothers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
by court-martial at Philadelphia, when it was notorious
that the proceedings must be protracted, and that
numerous witnesses must be summoned from Boston,
at great expense: the whole constituting a plain oppression,
not unlike the demand of “excessive bail.”</p>

<p>The hardship in these preliminary proceedings seemed
to justify an appeal to the President, in which I joined,
for his intervention at least to change the place of trial.
Perhaps they illustrate also the temper which entered
into this prosecution.</p>

<p>It is only since the President has put into my hands
the report on the findings of the Court, adopted by the
Secretary of the Navy, that I have looked into the case
on its merits. I have read that report carefully, and
also the arguments of the counsel on both sides; but I
have not had any opportunity to examine the whole
record. From the fulness of the report, and of the arguments,
this was hardly necessary. The record is extensively
cited in the report and the arguments, and
also in a pamphlet by one of the respondents, which
I have read.</p>

<p>The more I have examined the case, the more I have
been surprised by the preliminary proceedings, the continued
prosecution, and the findings of the Court. I
can well understand how they were used in the House
of Representatives as an argument for the total repeal
of the Act of Congress authorizing the trial of civilians
by courts-martial. Such a case must make us
fear, that, under this Act, justice may be sacrificed.
It might make honest merchants hesitate to enter into
business relations with the Government.</p>

<p>On careful examination, it seems that the whole
prosecution, so far as proof is seriously pretended, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
reduced to one single specification,&mdash;to wit, the sale
and delivery of five thousand pounds of a tin called
Revely, instead of a tin called Banca, by which, at
most, the Government lost one hundred dollars. There
are other specifications; but the report adopted by the
Secretary of the Navy forbears to dwell on them; and
I do not think they can be made the foundation of any
judgment against the respondents. They did not seem
to have impressed the President, in the conversation
which I had with him on the subject. I put them
aside as unproved or irrelevant. There only remains
the single specification with regard to tin.</p>

<p>Look at this carefully, and the wonder increases that
these proceedings were ever instituted.</p>

<p>1. The first remark to make is, that, even according
to the finding of the Court, the Government has suffered
only to the amount of one hundred dollars,&mdash;being
the difference in price between the two kinds of
tin at the date of delivery. <i>The pettiness of this loss</i> is
still more apparent, when it is considered that the transactions
of the respondents with the Government reached
the sum of more than twelve hundred thousand dollars,
having such infinite details that they covered twelve
hundred and five pages of sales. Surely, on every principle
of reason or evidence, the insignificance of this
loss, in transactions on so large a scale, and extending
over three years of time, constitutes an unanswerable
presumption in favor of the respondents, excluding, as
it does, any adequate motive for the perpetration of
fraud. Even assuming that the supply of tin was questionable,
it would be reasonable to call it ill-considered,
hasty, or mistaken, rather than criminal, according to
the finding of the Court. Certainly it could be no justification<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
of the vindictive arrest and bail with which
the proceedings began, and it is frightful that it should
be made the pretence for a sentence of two year’ imprisonment
and twenty thousand dollar’ fine. If a
mountain in labor ever brought forth a mouse, it is
this mountainous prosecution, whose only offspring yet
crawling on earth is an allegation of loss to the United
States of one hundred dollars! But, if we look further
at this transaction, it will be seen that it is absolutely
unimpeachable.</p>

<p>2. Much confusion has been caused by <i>ignorance
with regard to the two tins in question</i>. The report
adopted by the Secretary of the Navy says of them,
that, “in the course of commerce, <i>the two are never confounded
by dealers</i>”; then, again, that “Banca tin is
<i>one article</i>, having a certain price, and that Revely tin
is <i>another and a different article</i>, having a different
price.” The repetition of this assumption again and
again shows how important it was regarded in support
of the accusation. But this assumption is founded
on mistake.</p>

<p>I call attention to the letter of Hon. S. Hooper, addressed
to myself, under date of 14th March instant, in
which he testifies from his experience as an importer,
for many years, of these two tins. He says: “If the
only charge against Messrs. Smith Brothers &amp; Co. is the
delivery of Revely tin, on a contract to supply the Government
with Banca tin, it is an absurdity, and it is
evident to me that the Court did not know what Banca
tin was.” He then proceeds to say, that the tin of the
East passes under the <i>general name</i> of Banca tin, which
is applicable to the Revely or Straits tin as well as to
the Dutch; and he adduces the authority of the Commercial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
Dictionaries. Thus, McCulloch, under the word
“Tin,” after speaking of the tin of Great Britain, says,
“Tin, Oriental, in commercial language usually called
Banca tin,” produced, according to this authority, in
China, the Malay countries, and the islands lying toward
Java. He also cites Simmonds’s “Dictionary of Trade,”
published in London as late as 1858, which, under the
term “Banca-Tin,” says, “A valuable kind of tin, equal
to English refined, obtained in the Eastern Archipelago,
originally from the island of Banca exclusively; but
much is now procured in Malacca, and sent to Singapore
for shipment.” The latter, it will be borne in mind,
is what has been treated in this case as Revely.</p>

<p>Certainly, the testimony of Mr. Hooper, in concurrence
with the Commercial Dictionaries, must tend to
show that the report is mistaken, when it so confidently
asserts, that, “in the course of commerce, the two tins
are never confounded by dealers.” On the contrary,
they have been treated by “dealers,” and by authoritative
writers on commerce, as substantially the same.
It is almost superfluous for me to add, that, according
to the ruling of our courts, such testimony would be
decisive. Thus, where certain words were used in the
tariff, Mr. Justice Story decided, that, “the tariff being
a statute regulating commerce, the terms of it must
be construed <i>according to commercial usage and understanding</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>
Common sense is in harmony with this
judgment.</p>

<p>As if to put this <i>commercial usage</i> beyond question,
we have the testimony of Mr. Richards, a witness <i>for
the prosecution</i>, as follows.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Cross-Question 18.</i> Do you ever have orders from customers
for Banca tin, that you execute by the delivery of
Revely or Straits?&mdash;<i>Ans. We have.</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>Cross-Question 22.</i> Suppose you had an order from a
foundry&mdash;say Hooper &amp; Co.&mdash;for five thousand pounds
of Banca tin, which you knew was to be used for castings,
how would you fill such an order?&mdash;<i>Ans. We should not
hesitate to give him Revely.</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>Re-Cross-Question 1.</i> Would you not deliver to a party
five thousand pounds of Revely tin, upon a contract for
Banca tin, if you had never known them to buy such a quantity
of any kind but Revely or Straits, if you had repeatedly
sold them Revely or Straits acceptably, and you considered
the tin was to be used for castings?&mdash;<i>Ans. I should.</i>”</p>

</div>

<p>3. The <i>usage at the Navy Yard</i> was in harmony
with commercial usage, as the testimony abundantly
shows. For <i>at least seven years</i> previous to the contract
of the respondents, the tin known as Revely had
been received at the yard as Banca. Edward Cody,
witness for the prosecution, and the master founder,
on cross-examination, puts this beyond question.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Cross-Question 4.</i> During these seven years [past], has
not the Revely tin been the standard article in use in your
bureau or foundry?&mdash;<i>Ans. It has.</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>Cross-Question 11.</i> If you had been inquired of by them
[Smith Brothers &amp; Co.] what kind of tin you required, what
would have been your reply?&mdash;<i>Ans. I should have had the
same as I have had.</i></p>

<p>“<i>Cross-Question 12.</i> What is that?&mdash;<i>Ans. Revely.</i>”</p>

</div>

<p>Another witness, the Hon. Eugene L. Norton, the
Navy Agent at Boston, testifies, that, having occasion
to buy tin on a requisition from the Ordnance Office, he
sent to inquire of Captain Green, the Ordnance Officer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
what brand was required. The answer was, “that, in
all cases where it was foundry work, Revely or Straits
would be the kind that would be received; that, in
those cases where it was wanted in small quantities, for
solder, Banca would be preferred, as Revely or Straits
was somewhat cheaper than Banca.” And he added,
that the quantity named in the requisition, as a ton,
or a pig, would indicate the kind he should buy.
Add to the testimony of these two witnesses the undisputed
fact, that, when, in May, 1863, C. W. Schofield,
being under contract to deliver five thousand
pounds of Banca, failed to perform his contract, the
Government, although entitled to purchase the desired
article in open market at his expense, <i>bought Revely</i>.
Here was a practical interpretation of the contract,
which establishes the usage of the Navy Yard.</p>

<p>4. The <i>openness of the transaction</i> and of the delivery
testify also to the <i>usage</i>. The tin, when delivered, was
stamped upon its face “Revely &amp; Co.” This stamp,
which was open to the observation of all officers, workmen,
and passers-by, is an incontrovertible witness,
which no argument of counsel or ingenious commentary
can neutralize. Calmly, but unanswerably, it shows
two things: first, the usage at the Navy Yard; and,
secondly, the good faith of the transaction. But I refer
to it now simply to illustrate the usage.</p>

<p>5. Then comes <i>the acceptance of the tin</i> marked as
Revely, and the approval of the bills by the officers of
the Government, in performance of the contract. It is
not denied that the tin was accepted by Mr. Merriam,
the master machinist at the Navy Yard, and that the
bills were approved by Mr. Kimball, the inspecting officer
of Government,&mdash;an inspector who is said to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
been unfriendly to the respondents. This double fact is
beyond question. An attempt is made to throw doubt
on the integrity of one of these witnesses, by charging
complicity; but it does not appear that there is a scrap
of evidence in the record to sustain the imputation, and
I need not say it is outrageous to imagine it, in order
to increase the pressure upon the respondents. Mr.
Merriam, in his testimony, says: “I was influenced, undoubtedly,
<i>from my knowledge of the practice which had
existed heretofore</i>, and also from my belief that the article
answered every purpose in the department which
Banca tin was required for. <i>The previous practice of the
department</i>, of which I had been informed, in addition
to my own judgment <i>as to the substantial equality of
the articles</i>, were reasons for my approving the bill.”
Nothing could be more explicit or reasonable.</p>

<p>The report adopted by the Secretary of the Navy
seeks to parry the force of this approval by the allegation,
that “there is not a particle of proof on the record
that any one of the officers or other persons employed
at the Navy Yard, or in the transaction of its business,
had ever received from the Government any sort of authority
to make such inspection, approval, and payment
as appears in the case.” The report forgets <i>the usage of
seven years</i> at the Navy Yard, and <i>the commercial usage</i>
besides, which were ample to justify them.</p>

<p>6. As it is evident that the Government did not expect
to receive other than Revely, so it is proved that
<i>the respondents never expected to supply other than Revely</i>,
unless in cases of small quantities, where, as we
have seen, the Banca was supposed to be desired.
Such is the testimony of Benjamin G. Smith, one of
the respondents, and also of Mr. Dunnells, their clerk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
The latter states, that his instructions from the respondents
were to deliver Banca when small lots were
required, but Revely when large lots of one thousand
pounds and upwards were required, and that, as far
as his knowledge went, this had always been done.
Therefore the contract was performed according to <i>the
mutual understanding of the two parties</i>.</p>

<p>7. <i>The price</i>, according to the contract, shows that
the tin called Revely was intended. This can be demonstrated.</p>

<p>At the date of the contract, 30th March, 1863, the
price of Banca in the market was fifty-seven to fifty-eight
cents a pound. Revely was less. The price stipulated
in the contract was fifty-seven cents. But it is
plain that the respondents could not undertake to supply
an article at less than its market price. This would
be absurd. Of course, as merchants, they expected a profit.
Therefore, in their bid, they would naturally take
into consideration the various elements which would enter
into the final price. These would be, first, the original
price; secondly, the commission; thirdly, the condition
of the currency, which at that time had begun to
depreciate; fourthly, the variation of the market for a
month; fifthly, store expenses and interest; sixthly,
postponement of payment; and, seventhly, risks of a
contractor in placing himself within the unhesitating
grasp of military power. So far as these can be estimated,
they are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table class="small" summary="some numbers">
  <tr>
    <td>Original price</td><td>.52</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Store expenses and interest at 5 per cent</td><td>.0260</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td><td class="border-top">.5460</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Commission at 5 per cent</td><td>.0273</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td><td class="border-top">.5733</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>But the price was fifty-seven cents.</p>

<p>Now can any person, not to say any merchant, assert
that fifty-seven cents a pound was a high price for the
tin called Revely? Would anybody but a fool offer to
supply the tin which in this prosecution is called Banca
at fifty-seven cents a pound, when its original price
was more than this, and the contractor must lose store
expenses and interest, with the risks of currency, market,
postponement of payment, and military tribunals,
without the possibility of a mill for commissions?
Clearly not. It is evident, therefore, that, in offering
to supply Banca tin at fifty-seven cents a pound, they
must have intended that species of Banca tin known as
Revely, which, according to the usage of the Navy Yard
and of merchants, had been recognized as Banca tin.</p>

<p>On this point we have the testimony of Mr. Richards,
a witness for the Government, whose cross-examination
thus confirms the foregoing conclusion.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Cross-Question 37.</i> What would it be worth to give a
party the refusal for, say, five thousand pounds of tin for
twenty or thirty days?&mdash;<i>Ans. At least fifteen per cent.</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>Cross-Question 44.</i> During the year 1863, how much,
in addition to the cash market price, would you have considered
should be added for a refusal of thirty days?&mdash;<i>Ans.
From, ten to fifteen per cent.</i></p>

<p>“<i>Cross-Question 45.</i> Tin being sold to us at fifty and
three-fourths cents net cash in the market, would fifty-seven
cents be an improper sum for us to charge the Government
on a time refusal?&mdash;<i>Ans. I should think not.</i></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
<p>“<i>Cross-Question 46.</i> If you were to be subject to a delay
of vouchers for merchandise delivered for thirty days,
if there should be a reservation of twenty per cent until
the contract was closed, and if then you were liable to be
compelled to receive certificates of indebtedness that would
not sell in the market at par, what, in addition to the cash
market price, would you consider should be added?&mdash;<i>Ans.
From five to ten per cent, I should think.</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>Cross-Question 50.</i> Upon a Government contract, to run
three months or one year, with a reservation of twenty per
cent, a bid being made which amounts to a refusal for twenty
or thirty days, and subject to terms of Government payment,
what would you consider a fair addition to the cash
market price on a sale to the Government?&mdash;<i>Ans. At least
ten per cent.</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>Cross-Question 52.</i> Among Boston merchants what is
the character of the house of Smith Brothers &amp; Co. for integrity
and fair dealing?&mdash;<i>Ans. A No. 1.</i>”</p>

</div>

<p>Such is the testimony of a Government witness. In
the face of this testimony, concurring with the reason
of the case, it is hard to tolerate the allegation against
these respondents founded on price. Indeed, it is hard
to tolerate the allegation on any ground.</p>

<p>Under these seven heads, this whole case, so far as
concerns the contract for tin, may be considered. It
appears that the loss to the United States, from the delivery
of Revely instead of what is called Banca, was
not more than one hundred dollars in a mass of transactions
amounting to more than one million two hundred
thousand dollars; that, according to extensive and
long-continued usage, Revely is included under Banca;
that, according to usage at the Navy Yard, it was treated
as Banca; that the whole transaction and the delivery
were open and without any concealment; that Revely
was actually accepted by the officers of the Government
in performance of the contract; that the respondents
never expected to supply other than Revely; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
lastly, that the price paid shows that Revely was intended.
This is enough. I forbear to go into the evidence
of founders and plumbers, derived from experience,
of assayers and chemists, derived from analysis
of the two tins, and also of business men, as to
their comparative value,&mdash;for all this is superfluous.
To charge fraud against the respondents under such
circumstances is cruel, irrational, preposterous. Their
conduct cannot be tortured or twisted into fraud. As
well undertake to spin sunbeams into cables, or extract
oil from Massachusetts granite.</p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine the origin of these unfortunate
proceedings, which, beginning in unheard-of harshness,
threaten to end in unexampled injustice, unless
arrested by the President. But there are certain facts
which may shed light upon some of the hidden springs.
Nobody supposes that the able and candid Head of the
Navy Department became acquainted with this prosecution
until after it had been already conceived, shaped,
and set in motion. Others in the Department used its
great powers, if not for purposes of oppression, at least
recklessly and unaccountably.</p>

<p>It appears that Franklin W. Smith, one of the respondents,
published a pamphlet, in which he exposed
abuses in the contract system of the Navy Department;
and it is understood that sundry officials felt
aggrieved by these disclosures. The spirit of these officials
appears sufficiently in the following extract from
a letter of a Government witness, holding an important
position in the Navy Department, addressed to another
witness, himself also an official.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have been summoned before the Select Committee of
the Senate for investigating frauds in Naval Supplies; and
<i>if the wool don’t fly, it won’t be my fault</i>. Norton, the Navy
Agent, has complained that I have interfered with his business:
he and his friend Smith are <i>dead cocks in the pit. We
have got a sure thing on them in the tin business.</i> They that
dance must pay the fiddler.”</p>

</div>

<p>The writer of this letter, after appearing before the
Senate Committee at a later day, came on from Washington
to appear before the court-martial at Charlestown
as a witness against the respondents, where he
underwent a cross-examination on which I forbear to
comment. If the prosecution did not originate in the
spirit which fills his letter, it is evident that this spirit
entered into it. “If the wool don’t fly, it won’t be my
fault”; “Dead cocks in the pit”; “A sure thing on
them in the tin business”: such are the countersigns
adopted by the agent of this dark proceeding, showing
clearly two things: first, the foregone conclusion, that
these respondents were to be sacrificed; and, secondly,
that the case turned on “the tin business.”</p>

<p>It is hard that citizens enjoying a good name, who
had the misfortune to come into business relations with
the Government, should be exposed to such a spirit;
that they should be dragged from their homes, and hurried
to a military prison; that, though civilians, they
should be treated as military offenders; that they should
be compelled to undergo a protracted trial by court-martial,
damaging their good name, destroying their
peace, breaking up their business, and subjecting them
to untold expense,&mdash;when, at the slightest touch, the
whole case vanishes into thin air, leaving behind nothing
but the incomprehensible spirit in which it had its
origin.</p>

<p>Of course, the findings and sentence of the Court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
ought, without delay, to be set aside. But this is
only the beginning of justice. Some positive reparation
should be made to citizens who have been so
deeply injured.</p>

<p class="medium"><span class="smcap">Washington</span>, March 17, 1865.</p>

<p class="noindent medium"><span class="smcap">To the President of the United States.</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="medium">

<p>The President promptly overruled the judgment and sentence. The
result was received with manifestations of joy. The defendants, whose
cruel prosecution had been protracted for six months, had an ovation
in the congratulations of their friends and fellow-citizens. Strangers
at a distance, feeling that public liberty had suffered through them,
sent their sympathy. The press gave expression to the prevailing sentiment.
Nor was Mr. Sumner forgotten. The defendants made haste
by telegraph to say: “Accept the lasting gratitude of Smith Brothers,
their families, and their many friends.” Others wrote in the same
spirit,&mdash;as, for instance, J. C. Hoadley, of New Bedford, who, though
not knowing the sufferers, said: “I thank you, in the name of all fair
dealing, for your opinion upon the case of Franklin W. Smith”; and
John Clark, who, having been connected with the press in Boston, had
passed into the public service, wrote from Norfolk:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Will you permit me to thank you for your able exposition of the case
of the Smith Brothers? I do not know those parties; but I am interested
in public liberty, and I have seen no abler defender of it, since the beginning
of the war, than you have shown yourself to be on this occasion. I
thank you, Sir.”</p>

</div>

<p>From these expressions it appears that the effort of Mr. Sumner was
regarded as not only a defence of the individual citizen, but a contribution
to good government. The testimony of Mr. Clark was of the more
value, as he had not been accustomed to sympathize with Mr. Sumner
in his public course.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Independent of its character, this case has an incidental interest. It
was one of the last, if not the last, having a personal relation, that ever
occupied the mind of President Lincoln. His indorsement, overruling
the judgment and sentence, bears date March 18th. This was Saturday.
Meanwhile the Rebellion was about to fall, and the President
left Washington, by boat, Thursday, March 23d, for City Point, the
headquarters of the Army of Virginia, where he remained till after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
surrender of Richmond, returning to Washington Sunday evening,
April 9th, and being assassinated Friday evening, April 14th.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some circumstances associated with this case help exhibit the character
of the President. They will be stated briefly. As soon as Mr.
Sumner had prepared his Opinion, he hurried to the President. It was
late in the afternoon, and the latter was about entering his carriage for
a drive, when Mr. Sumner arrived with the papers in his hand. He at
once mentioned the result he had reached, and added that it was a
case for instant action. The President proposed that he should return
the next day, when he would consider it with him. Mr. Sumner rejoined,
that, in his opinion, the President ought not to sleep on the
case,&mdash;that he should interfere promptly for the relief of innocent fellow-citizens,&mdash;and
urged, that, if Abraham Lincoln had suffered unjust
imprisonment as a criminal, with degradation before his neighbors,
an immense bill of expense, a trial by court-martial, and an unjust
condemnation, he would cry out against any postponement of justice
for a single day. The President, apparently impressed by Mr. Sumner’s
earnestness and his personal appeal, appointed eleven o’clock that
evening, when he would go over the case, and hear Mr. Sumner’s
Opinion.</p>

<p>Accordingly, at eleven o’clock that evening, in the midst of a thunder-storm,
filling the streets with water, and threatening chimneys, Mr.
Sumner made his way to the Presidential mansion. At the very hour
named he was received, and at the request of the President proceeded
to read his Opinion. The latter listened attentively, with occasional
comments, and at the close showed his sympathy with the respondents.
It was now twenty minutes after midnight, when the President said
that he would write his conclusion at once, and that Mr. Sumner
must come and hear it the next morning,&mdash;“when I open shop,” said
he. “And when do you open shop?” Mr. Sumner inquired. “At
nine o’clock,” was the reply. At that hour Mr. Sumner was in the
office he had left after midnight, when the President came running in,
and read at once the indorsement in his own handwriting, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am unwilling for the sentence to stand and be executed, to any extent,
in this case. In the absence of a more adequate motive than the
evidence discloses, I am wholly unable to believe in the existence of criminal
or fraudulent intent on the part of one of such well-established good
character as is the accused. If the evidence went as far toward establishing
a guilty profit of one or two hundred thousand dollars, as it does of one
or two hundred dollars, the case would, on the question of guilt, bear a far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
different aspect. That on this contract, involving from one million to twelve
hundred thousand dollars, the contractors should attempt a fraud which at
the most could profit them only one or two hundred, or even one thousand
dollars, is to my mind beyond the power of rational belief. That they
did not, in such a case, strike for greater gains proves that they did not,
with guilty or fraudulent intent, strike at all. The judgment and sentence
are disapproved and declared null, and the accused ordered to be discharged.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">A. Lincoln.</span></p>

<p>“March 18, 1865.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then followed an incident as original as anything in the life of
Henry the Fourth, of France, or of a Lacedæmonian king. As
Mr. Sumner was making an abstract of the indorsement for communication
by telegraph to the anxious parties, the President broke into
quotation from Petroleum V. Nasby, and, seeing that his visitor was
less at home than himself in this patriotic literature, he said, “I must
initiate you,” and then repeated with enthusiasm the message he
had sent to the author: “For the genius to write these things I would
gladly give up my office.” Then rising and turning to a standing-desk
behind, he opened it and took out a pamphlet collection of the letters
already published, which he proceeded to read aloud, evidently enjoying
it much. For the time he seemed to forget the case he had just
decided, and Presidential duties. This continued more than twenty
minutes, when Mr. Sumner, thinking there must be many at the door
waiting to see the President on graver matters, took advantage of a
pause, and, thanking him for the lesson of the morning, left. Some
thirty persons, including Senators and Representatives, were in the
anteroom as he passed out.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>Though with the President much during the intervening days before
his death, this was the last business Mr. Sumner transacted with him.</p>

<p>President Lincoln breathed his last on the morning of Saturday,
April 15th. Congress not being in session, there was a meeting of Senators
and Representatives then in Washington, April 17th, at noon,
when Hon. Lafayette S. Foster, President <i>pro tempore</i> of the Senate, was
called to the Chair, and Hon. Schuyler Colfax was chosen Secretary.
Senator Foot, of Vermont, stated the object of the meeting. On motion
of Mr. Sumner, a Committee of five from each House was ordered
to report at four o’clock, <span class="smcapuc">P. M.</span>, on the action proper for the meeting.
The Chair appointed Mr. Sumner, Mr. Harris, of New York, Mr. Reverdy
Johnson, of Maryland, Mr. Ramsey, of Minnesota, and Mr. Conness,
of California, on the part of the Senate, also Mr. Washburne, of
Illinois, Mr. Smith, of Kentucky, Mr. Schenck, of Ohio, Mr. Pike, of
Maine, and Mr. Coffroth, of Pennsylvania, on the part of the House of
Representatives. On motion of Mr. Schenck, the Chairman and Secretary
of the meeting were added to the Committee.</p>

<p>The Committee reported a list of pall-bearers for the funeral, and
also a Congressional Committee of one from each State to accompany
the remains of the late President to Illinois, which were adopted by
the meeting.</p>

<p>They also reported the following resolution, drawn by Mr. Sumner,

this informal meeting, to express the emotions with
which they have been filled by the appalling tragedy
that has deprived the nation of its head and covered
the land with mourning, and, in further declaration of
their sentiments, resolve unanimously,&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That, in testimony of their veneration and affection
for the illustrious dead, who has been permitted,
under Providence, to do so much for his country and
for Liberty, they will unite in the funeral services, and
by an appropriate committee will accompany his remains
to their place of burial in the State from which
he was taken for the national service.</p>

<p>2. That in the life of Abraham Lincoln, who, by the
benignant favor of republican institutions, rose from
humble beginnings to the height of power and fame,
they recognize an example of purity, simplicity, and
virtue which should be a lesson to mankind; while in
his death they acknowledge a martyr whose memory
will become more precious as men learn to prize those
principles of constitutional order, and those rights, civil,
political, and human, for which he was made a sacrifice.</p>

<p>3. That they invite the President of the United
States, by solemn proclamation, to recommend that the
people of the United States should assemble on a day
appointed by him, in public testimony of their grief,
and to dwell on the good that has been done on earth

Colored Union Leagues of this city, respectfully ask your attention to
the subject of Reconstruction in this State, and for a few plain directions
in relation to a proper stand for us to make.</p>

<p>We forward also a copy of the <i>Herald</i>, containing an article on Reconstruction,
which causes us much anxiety, in connection with other facts
that are constantly pressed upon our attention in this Rebel State, although
much is said concerning its loyalty that is unreliable and untrue. Many of
us have done service for the United States Government, at Fort Fisher
and elsewhere, and we shrink with horror at the thought that we may
be left to the tender mercies of our former Rebel masters, who have taken
the oath, but are filled with malice, and swear vengeance against us as soon
as the military are withdrawn.</p>

<p>We are loyal colored citizens, and strive in all things so to conduct ourselves
that no just cause of complaint may exist, although we suffer much
from the unwillingness of the Secessionists to regard us as <i>freemen</i>, and
look up to the flag of our country with trembling anxiety, knowing that the
<i>franchise</i> alone can give us security for the future.</p>

<p>We speak with moderation and care, we lay no charges, but we fear that
an ill-judged lenity to Rebels in this State will leave little to us and our
children but the bare name of freedmen. We remember Louisiana! Better
“smash the egg” than permit it to produce a viper.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>This letter was extensively circulated. The New York <i>Herald</i>
printed it in an editorial article entitled “The Chase-Sumner Political
Movement&mdash;Social War Threatened,” where it said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As soon as Mr. Johnson assumed the reins of the Government, Mr.
Sumner made an effort to control his official action and secure his assistance
in carrying on this appendix warfare to the Abolition question, and
thus plunge the country into a sanguinary social war. Finding it impossible
to draw President Johnson into his schemes, he at once plants himself
in opposition.…</p>

<p>“This letter, although short, is explicit and unmistakable in its meaning.
Its purpose is evident to the most casual observer. Knowing, as he
must, at the time, that the President held that the question of conferring
the privilege of suffrage upon the colored people of the South rested exclusively
with the States, he endeavors to stir up a feud and create a dissatisfaction
among this class. Like the speech of Chief Justice Chase, its
whole tendency is to incite the negroes to insurrection, by giving them the
impression that the Government is against them. There is not a word in
the communication counselling obedience or respect to the laws of the Government.
They ask him for direction, and he, in response, counsels them
to take part in the organization of the Government,&mdash;that it is their right
and duty. In the face of the fact that there is no law in their State or
in the Constitution of the United States recognizing that right, he tells them
that those who oppose them are usurpers and impostors.”</p>

<h3>EULOGY</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">In the universe of God there are no accidents. From
the fall of a sparrow to the fall of an empire or the
sweep of a planet, all is according to Divine Providence,
whose laws are everlasting. No accident gave to his
country the patriot we now honor. No accident snatched
this patriot, so suddenly and so cruelly, from his sublime
duties. Death is as little an accident as life.
Never, perhaps, in history has this Providence been more
conspicuous than in that recent procession of events,
where the final triumph is wrapped in the gloom of
tragedy. It is our present duty to find the moral of
the stupendous drama.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For the second time in our annals, the country is
summoned by the President to unite, on an appointed
day, in commemorating the life and character of the
dead. The first was on the death of <span class="smcap">George Washington</span>,
when, as now, a day was set apart for simultaneous
eulogy throughout the land, and cities, towns,
and villages all vied in tribute. Since this early observance
for the Father of his Country more than half
a century has passed, and now it is repeated in tribute
to <span class="smcap">Abraham Lincoln</span>.</p>

<p>Thus are <span class="smcap">Washington</span> and <span class="smcap">Lincoln</span> associated in the
grandeur of their obsequies. But this association is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
accidental. It is from the nature of things, and because
the part Lincoln was called to perform resembled in
character the part performed by Washington. The work
left undone by Washington was continued by Lincoln.
Kindred in service, kindred in patriotism, each is surrounded
in death by kindred homage. One sleeps in
the East, the other sleeps in the West; and thus, in
death, as in life, one is the complement of the other.</p>

<p>The two might be compared after the manner of
Plutarch; but it must suffice for the present to glance
only at points of resemblance and of contrast, so as to
recall the parts they respectively performed.</p>

<p>Each was head of the Republic during a period of
surpassing trial; and each thought only of the public
good, simply, purely, constantly, so that single-hearted
devotion to country will always find a synonym in their
names. Each was national chief during a time of successful
war. Each was representative of his country
at a great epoch of history. Here, perhaps, resemblance
ends and contrast begins. Unlike in origin, conversation,
and character, they were unlike also in the <i>ideas</i>
they served, except as each was servant of his country.
The war conducted by Washington was unlike the war
conducted by Lincoln, as the peace which crowned the
arms of the one was unlike the peace which began to
smile upon the other. The two wars did not differ in
scale of operations and in tramp of mustered hosts more
than in the ideas involved. The first was for National
Independence; the second was to make the Republic
one and indivisible, on the indestructible foundation of
Liberty and Equality. The first cut the connection
with the mother country, and opened the way to the
duties and advantages of Popular Government; <i>the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
will have failed, unless it consummates all the original
promises of the Declaration our fathers took upon
their lips when they became a Nation</i>. In the relation
of cause and effect the first was natural precursor and
herald of the second. National Independence became
the first epoch in our history, whose mighty import
was exhibited when Lafayette boasted to the First Consul
of France, that, though its battles were but skirmishes,
they decided the fate of the world.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>The Declaration of our fathers, entitled simply “The
Unanimous Declaration of the Thirteen United States
of America,” is known familiarly as the Declaration
of Independence, because the remarkable words with
which it concludes made independence the final idea,
to which all else was tributary. Thus did the representatives
of the United States of America in General
Congress assembled solemnly publish and declare “that
these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free
and independent States; that they are absolved from
all allegiance to the British Crown; and that all political
connection between them and the State of Great
Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved; … and
for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance
on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually
pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our
sacred honor.” To sustain this mutual pledge Washington
drew his sword and led the national armies, until
at last, by the Treaty of Peace in 1783, Independence
was acknowledged.</p>

<p>Had the Declaration been confined to this pledge, it
would have been less grand. Much as it might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
been to us, it would have been less of a warning and
trumpet-note to the world. There were two other
pledges it made. One was proclaimed in the designation
“United States of America,” which it adopted
as the national name; and the other was proclaimed
in those great words, fit for the baptismal vows of a
Republic,&mdash;“We hold these truths to be self-evident:
<i>that all men are created equal</i>; that they are endowed
by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that
among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;
that to secure these rights governments are instituted
among men, <i>deriving their just powers from the
consent of the governed</i>.” By the sword of Washington
Independence was secured; but the Unity of the Republic
and the principles of the Declaration were left
exposed to question. From that early day, through
various chances, they were assailed and openly dishonored,
until at last the Republic was constrained
to take up arms in their defence. And yet, since enmity
to the Union proceeded entirely from enmity to
the great ideas of the Declaration, history must record
that the question of the Union itself was absorbed in
the grander conflict to uphold the primal truths our
fathers had solemnly proclaimed.</p>

<p>Such are the two great wars where these two chiefs
bore each his part. Washington fought for National
Independence, and triumphed, making his country an
example to mankind. Lincoln drew a reluctant sword
to save those great ideas, essential to the life and character
of the Republic, which unhappily the sword of
Washington failed to put beyond the reach of assault.</p>

<p>By no accident did these two great men become representatives
of their country at these two different epochs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
so alike in peril, and yet so unlike in the principles
involved. Washington was the natural representative
of National Independence. He might also have
represented National Unity, had this principle been
challenged to bloody battle during his life; for nothing
was nearer his heart than the consolidation of our
Union, which, in his letter to Congress transmitting the
Constitution, he declares to be “the greatest interest
of every true American.”<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> Then again, in a remarkable
letter to John Jay, he plainly says that he does “not
conceive we can exist long as a nation without having
lodged somewhere a power which will pervade the
whole Union in as energetic a manner as the authority
of the State governments extends over the several
States.”<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> But another person was needed, of different
birth and simpler life, to represent the ideas now impugned.</p>

<p>Washington was of ancient family, traced in English
heraldry. Some of his ancestors sleep in close
companionship with the noble name of Spencer. By
inheritance and marriage he was rich in lands, and, let
it be said in respectful sorrow, rich also in slaves, so far
as slaves breed riches rather than curses. At the age
of fourteen he refused a commission as midshipman in
the British Navy. At the age of nineteen he was Adjutant
General, with the rank of major. At the age of
twenty-one he was selected by the British Governor of
Virginia as Commissioner to the French posts. At the
age of twenty-two he was at the head of a regiment, and
was thanked by the House of Burgesses. Early in life
he became an observer of form and ceremony. Always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
strictly just, according to prevailing principles, and at
his death ordering the emancipation of his slaves, he
was more a general and statesman than philanthropist;
nor did he seem inspired, beyond the duties of patriotism,
to active sympathy with Human Rights. In the
ample record of what he wrote or said there is no word
of adhesion to the great ideas of the Declaration. Such
an origin, such an early life, such opportunities, such a
condition, such a character, were all in contrast with
the origin, early life, opportunities, condition, and character
of him we commemorate to-day.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Abraham Lincoln was born, and, until he became
President, always lived in a part of the country which
at the period of the Declaration of Independence was a
savage wilderness. Strange, but happy, Providence, that
a voice from that savage wilderness, now fertile in men,
was inspired to uphold the pledges and promises of the
Declaration! The Unity of the Republic, on the indestructible
foundation of Liberty and Equality, was vindicated
by the citizen of a community which had no
existence when the Republic was formed.</p>

<p>His family may be traced to Quaker stock in Pennsylvania,
but it removed first to Virginia, and then, as
early as 1780, to the wilds of Kentucky, which at that
time was only an outlying territory of Virginia. His
grandfather and father both lived in peril from Indians,
and the former perished by their knife. The future
President was born in a log-house. His mother could
read, and perhaps write. His father could do neither,
except so far as to sign his name rudely, like a noble
of Charlemagne. Trial, privation, and labor entered into
his early life. Only at seven years of age, for a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
brief period, could he enjoy school, carrying with him
Dilworth’s Spelling-Book, one of the three volumes
that formed the family library. Shortly afterwards
his father turned his back upon that Slavery which
disfigured Kentucky, and with his poor effects and
the future chief-magistrate set his face towards Indiana,
already guarded against Slavery by the famous
Northwestern Ordinance. Reaching the chosen home
in a land of Liberty, the son, who was less than eight
years old, aided his father in building a shelter of
poles, fastened together by notches, and filled in with
mud. This preceded the log cabin, where for twelve
years afterwards he grew in character and knowledge,
as in stature, learning to write as well as read, and
especially enjoying Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress, Æsop’s
Fables, Weems’s Life of Washington, and the Life of
Henry Clay. At the age of ten he lost his mother.
At the age of nineteen he became a hired hand, at eight
dollars a month, on a flatboat laden with stores for
plantations on the Mississippi, and in this way floated
on that lordly river to New Orleans, little dreaming
that only a few years later iron-clad navies would at
his command float on that same proud stream. Here
also was he learner. From the slaves he saw on the
banks he took a lesson of Liberty, which gained new
charms by comparison with Slavery.</p>

<p>In 1830 the father removed to Illinois, transporting
his goods in a wagon drawn by oxen, and the future
President, then twenty-one years of age, drove the team.
Another cabin was built in primitive rudeness, and
the future President split the rails to inclose the lot.
In our history these became classical, and the name of
rail-splitter more than the degree of a college,&mdash;not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
that the splitting of rails is any way meritorious, but
because the people are proud to trace aspiring talent
back to humble beginnings, and they found in this tribute
new opportunity to vindicate the dignity of free labor,
and repel the insolent pretensions of Slavery.</p>

<p>His youth was now spent, and at the age of twenty-one
he left his father’s house to begin the world. A
small bundle, a laughing face, and an honest heart,&mdash;these
were his simple possessions, together with that
unconscious character and intelligence which his country
learned to prize. In the long history of worth depressed
there is no instance of such contrast between
the depression and the triumph,&mdash;unless, perhaps, his
successor as President may share with him this distinction.
No academy, no university, no Alma Mater
of science or learning nourished him. No government
took him by the hand and gave him the gift of opportunity.
No inheritance of land or money fell to him.
No friend stood by his side. He was alone in poverty:
and yet not all alone. There was God above, who
watches all, and does not desert the lowly. Plain in
person, life, and manners, and knowing absolutely nothing
of form or ceremony, for six months with a village
schoolmaster as his only teacher, he grew up in companionship
with the people, with Nature, with trees, with
the fruitful corn, and with the stars. While yet a child,
his father had borne him away from a soil wasted by
Slavery, and he was now citizen of a Free State, where
Free Labor had been placed under safeguard of irreversible
compact and fundamental law. And thus he took
leave of youth, happy at least that he could go forth
under the day-star of Liberty.</p>

<p>The early hardships were prolonged into manhood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
He labored on a farm as hired hand, and then a second
time in a flatboat measured the winding Mississippi to
its mouth. At the call of the Governor of Illinois
for troops against Black Hawk, the Indian chief, he
sprang forward with patriotic ardor, most prompt to
enlist at the recruiting station in his neighborhood.
The choice of his associates made him captain. After
the war he became surveyor, and to his death retained
a practical and scientific knowledge of this business.
Here again was a parallel with Washington. In 1834
he was elected to the Legislature of Illinois, and three
years later was admitted to the practice of the law.
He was now twenty-eight years old, and, under the
benignant influence of republican institutions, he had
already entered upon the double career of lawyer and
legislator, with the gates of the mysterious Future
slowly opening before him.</p>

<p>How well he served in these two characters I pause
not to tell. It is enough, if I exhibit the stages of advance,
that you may understand how he became representative
of his country at so grand a moment. It is
needless to say that his opportunities of study as a lawyer
were small, but he was industrious in each individual
case, and thus daily added to his stores of professional
experience. Faithful in all things, most conscientious
in conduct at the bar, so that he could not be
unfair to the other side, and admirably sensitive to the
behests of justice, so that he could not argue on the
wrong side, he acquired a name for honesty, which, beginning
with the community where he lived, became
proverbial throughout his State,&mdash;while his genial,
mirthful, overflowing nature, apt at anecdote and story,
made him, where personally known, a favorite companion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
His opinions on public questions were formed early,
under the example and teaching of Henry Clay, and he
never departed from them, though constantly tempted,
or pressed by local majorities, in the name of a false
democracy. It is interesting to know that thus early
he espoused those two ideas which entered so largely
into the terrible responsibilities of his last years,&mdash;I
mean the Unity of the Republic, and the supreme value
of Liberty. He did not believe that a State, in its own
mad will, had a right to break up this Union. As
reader of Congressional speeches, and student of what
was said by the political teachers of that day, he was
no stranger to those marvellous efforts of Daniel Webster,
when, in reply to the treasonable pretensions of
Nullification, the great orator of Massachusetts asserted
the indestructibility of the Union, and the folly of
those who assail it. On the subject of Slavery, he had
the experience of his own family and the warnings of
his own conscience. Naturally, one of his earliest acts
in the Legislature of Illinois was a protest in the name
of Liberty.</p>

<p>At a later day, he was in Congress for a single term,
beginning in December, 1847, being the only Whig
Representative from Illinois. His speeches during this
brief period have the characteristics of his later productions.
They are argumentative, logical, and spirited,
with quaint humor and sinewy sententiousness. His
votes were constant against Slavery. For the Wilmot
Proviso he voted, according to his own statement, “in
one way and another, about forty times.” His vote
is recorded against the pretence that slaves are property
under the Constitution. From Congress he passed
again to his profession. The day was at hand, when all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
his powers, enlarged by experience and quickened to
highest activity, would be needed to repel that haughty
domination already overshadowing the Republic.</p>

<p>The next field of conflict was in his own State, with
no less an antagonist than Stephen A. Douglas, at that
time in alliance with the Slave Power. The too famous
Kansas and Nebraska Bill, introduced by the latter into
the Senate, assumed to set aside the venerable safeguard
of Freedom in the territory west of Missouri, under pretence
of allowing the inhabitants “to vote Slavery up
or to vote it down,” and this barbarous privilege was
called by the fancy name of Popular Sovereignty. The
champion of Liberty did not hesitate to denounce this
most baleful measure in a series of popular addresses,
where truth, sentiment, humor, and argument all blended.
As the conflict continued, he was brought forward
for the Senate against its able author. The debate
that ensued is one of the most memorable in our political
history, whether we consider the principles involved
or the way it was conducted.</p>

<p>It commenced with a close, well-woven speech from
the Republican candidate, showing insight into the actual
condition of things, in which were these memorable
words: “‘A house divided against itself cannot stand.’
I believe this Government cannot endure permanently
half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to
be dissolved, I do not expect the house to fall, but I
do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become
all one thing, or all the other.”<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Here was the true
starting-point. Only a few days before his death, in
reply to my inquiry, if at the time he had any doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
about this declaration, he said, “Not in the least. It
was clearly true, and time has justified me.” With like
plainness he exposed the Douglas pretence of Popular
Sovereignty as meaning simply, “that, if any <i>one</i> man
choose to enslave <i>another</i>, no <i>third</i> man shall be allowed
to object,”<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> and he announced his belief in the
existence of a conspiracy to perpetuate and nationalize
Slavery, of which the Kansas and Nebraska Bill and
the Dred Scott decision were essential parts. Such was
the character of this debate at the beginning, and so it
continued on the lips of our champion to the end.</p>

<p>The inevitable topic to which he returned with most
frequency, and to which he clung with all the grasp of
his soul, was <i>the practical character of the Declaration
of Independence in announcing the Liberty and Equality
of all Men</i>. No idle words were there, but substantial
truth, binding on the conscience of mankind. I know
not if this grand pertinacity has been noticed before;
but I deem it a duty to declare that to my mind it is
by far the most important incident of that controversy,
and perhaps the most interesting in the biography of the
speaker. Nothing previous to his nomination for the
Presidency is comparable to it. Plainly his whole subsequent
career took impulse and complexion from that
championship. And here, too, is our first debt of gratitude.
The words he then uttered live after him, and nobody
now hears how he then battled without feeling a
new motive to fidelity in support of Human Rights.</p>

<p>As early as 1854, in a speech at Peoria against the
Kansas and Nebraska Bill, after denouncing Slavery as
a “monstrous injustice,” which “enables the enemies of
free institutions to taunt us as hypocrites,” and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span> “causes
the real friends of Freedom to doubt our sincerity,”
he complains especially that “it forces so many really
good men amongst ourselves <i>into open war with the
very fundamental principles of civil liberty, criticizing
the Declaration of Independence</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> Thus, according to
him, criticism of the Declaration was the climax of infidelity
as citizen.</p>

<p>Mr. Douglas opened the debate, on his side, at Chicago,
July 9, 1858, by a speech, where he said, among
other things, “I am opposed to negro equality. I repeat,
that this nation is a white people.… I am opposed
to taking any step that recognizes the negro man or the
Indian as the equal of the white man. I am opposed
to giving him a voice in the administration of the Government.”<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>
Thus was the case stated for Slavery.</p>

<p>To this speech the Republican candidate replied
promptly, and did not forget his championship. Quoting
the great words, “We hold these truths to be self-evident,
that all men are created equal,” he proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That is the electric cord in that Declaration that links
the hearts of patriotic and liberty-loving men together, that
will link those patriotic hearts as long as the love of freedom
exists in the minds of men throughout the world.…
I should like to know, if, taking this old Declaration of Independence,
which declares that all men are equal, upon principle,
and making exceptions to it, where will it stop? If
one man says it does not mean a negro, why not another
say it does not mean some other man? If that Declaration
is not the truth, let us get the statute-book in which we
find it and tear it out. Who is so bold as to do it? If it
is not true, let us tear it out. [<i>Cries of “No, no!”</i>] <i>Let
us stick to it, then; let us stand firmly by it, then.</i>”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>Noble utterance, worthy of perpetual memory! And
he finished his speech with a farewell truly apostolic:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I leave you, hoping that the lamp of Liberty will burn
in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that
all men are created free and equal.”<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

</div>

<p>He has left us now, and for the last time. I catch
the closing benediction of that speech, already sounding
through the ages like a choral harmony.</p>

<p>The debate continued from place to place. At Bloomington,
July 16th, Mr. Douglas denied again that colored
persons could be citizens, and then broke forth upon the
champion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I will not quarrel with Mr. Lincoln for his views on that
subject. I have no doubt he is conscientious in them. I
have not the slightest idea but that he conscientiously
believes that a negro ought to enjoy and exercise all the
rights and privileges given to white men; but I do not agree
with him.… <i>I believe that this government of ours was
founded on the white basis.</i> I believe that it was established
by white men.… I do not believe that it was the design
or intention of the signers of the Declaration of Independence
or the framers of the Constitution to include
negroes, Indians, or other inferior races, with white men, as
citizens.… <i>He wants them to vote. I am opposed to it.
If they had a vote, I reckon they would all vote for him in
preference to me, entertaining the views I do.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then again at Springfield, the next day, Mr. Douglas
repeated his denial that the colored man was embraced
by the Declaration, and thus argued for the exclusion:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Remember that at the time the Declaration was put
forth, every one of the Thirteen Colonies were slaveholding
colonies,&mdash;every man who signed that Declaration represented
slaveholding constituents. Did those signers mean
by that act to charge themselves and all their constituents
with having violated the law of God in holding the negro
in an inferior condition to the white man? And yet, if
they included negroes in that term, they were bound, as
conscientious men, that day and that hour, not only to have
abolished Slavery throughout the land, <i>but to have conferred
political rights and privileges on the negro, and elevated him
to an equality with the white man</i>.… The Declaration
of Independence only included the white people of the
United States.”<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

</div>

<p>On the same evening, at Springfield, the Republican
candidate, while admitting that negroes are not “our
equal in color,” thus again spoke for the comprehensive
humanity of the Declaration:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>I adhere to the Declaration of Independence. If Judge
Douglas and his friends are not willing to stand by it, let
them come up and amend it. Let them make it read, that all
men are created equal except negroes.</i> Let us have it decided,
whether the Declaration of Independence, in this blessed
year of 1858, shall be thus amended. In his construction
of the Declaration last year, he said it only meant that
Americans in America were equal to Englishmen in England.
Then, when I pointed out to him that by that rule
he excludes the Germans, the Irish, the Portuguese, and all
the other people who have come amongst us since the Revolution,
he reconstructs his construction. In his last speech
he tells us it meant Europeans. I press him a little further,
and ask if it meant to include the Russians in Asia. Or
does he mean to exclude that vast population from the principles
of our Declaration of Independence? I expect erelong
he will introduce another amendment to his definition. He
is not at all particular.… <i>It may draw white men down,
but it must not lift negroes up.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Words like these are gratefully remembered. They
make the Declaration, what the Fathers intended, no
mean proclamation of oligarchic egotism, but a charter
and freehold for all mankind.</p>

<p>At Ottawa, August 21st, Mr. Douglas, still excluding
the colored men from the Declaration, exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I believe this Government was made on the white basis.
I believe it was made by white men, for the benefit of white
men and their posterity forever.”<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Again the Republican champion took up the strain.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Henry Clay once said of a class of men who would repress
all tendencies to Liberty and ultimate Emancipation,
that they must, if they would do this, go back to the era of
our Independence, and muzzle the cannon which thunders
its annual joyous return,&mdash;they must blow out the moral
lights around us,&mdash;they must penetrate the human soul,
and eradicate there the love of Liberty; and then, and not
till then, could they perpetuate Slavery in this country.
To my thinking, Judge Douglas is, by his example and vast
influence, doing that very thing in this community, when
he says that the negro has nothing in the Declaration of
Independence.”<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

</div>

<p>At Jonesboro’, September 15th, Mr. Douglas once
more assailed the rights of the colored race.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am aware that all the Abolition lecturers that you
find travelling about through the country are in the habit
of reading the Declaration of Independence to prove that all
men were created equal, and endowed by their Creator with
certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness. Mr. Lincoln is very much in the
habit of following in the track of Lovejoy in this particular,
by reading that part of the Declaration of Independence to
prove that the negro was endowed by the Almighty with the
inalienable right of equality with white men. Now I say
to you, my fellow-citizens, that, in my opinion, the signers
of the Declaration had no reference to the negro whatever,
when they declared all men to be created equal.”<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

</div>

<p>At Galesburg, October 7th, his faithful opponent answered:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Judge has alluded to the Declaration of Independence,
and insisted that negroes are not included in that
Declaration, and that it is a slander upon the framers of
that instrument to suppose that negroes were meant therein;
and he asks you, Is it possible to believe that Mr. Jefferson,
who penned the immortal paper, could have supposed himself
applying the language of that instrument to the negro race,
and yet held a portion of that race in slavery? Would he
not at once have freed them? I only have to remark upon
this part of the Judge’s speech, that I believe the entire
records of the world, from the date of the Declaration of Independence
up to within three years ago, may be searched in
vain for one single affirmation from one single man, that the
negro was not included in the Declaration. And I will remind
Judge Douglas and this audience, that, while Mr. Jefferson
was the owner of slaves, as undoubtedly he was, in
speaking upon this very subject, he used the strong language,
that ‘he trembled for his country when he remembered
that God was just.’”<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>And at Alton, October 15th, he renewed this same
testimony.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I assert that Judge Douglas and all his friends may search
the whole records of the country, and it will be a matter of
great astonishment to me, if they shall be able to find that
one human being three years ago had ever uttered the astounding
sentiment that the term ‘all men’ in the Declaration
did not include the negro. Do not let me be misunderstood.
I know that more than three years ago there
were men, who, finding this assertion constantly in the way
of their schemes to bring about the ascendency and perpetuation
of Slavery, denied the truth of it. I know that Mr.
Calhoun, and all the politicians of his school, denied the
truth of the Declaration. I know that it ran along in the
mouth of some Southern men for a period of years, ending
at last in that shameful, though rather forcible, declaration
of Pettit, of Indiana, upon the floor of the United States
Senate, that the Declaration of Independence was, in that
respect, ‘a self-evident lie,’ rather than a self-evident truth.
But I say, with a perfect knowledge of all this hawking at
the Declaration without directly attacking it, that three
years ago there never had lived a man who had ventured to
assail it in <i>the sneaking way of pretending to believe it, and
then asserting it did not include the negro</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In another speech, during the same political contest,
the champion spoke immortal words. After setting
forth the sublime opening of the Declaration by our
fathers, he said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This was their majestic interpretation of the economy
of the universe. This was their lofty and wise and noble
understanding of the justice of the Creator to His creatures,&mdash;yes,
Gentlemen, to all His creatures, to the whole great
family of man.”</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>
<p>Then, lifted by his cause, he appealed to his fellow-countrymen
in tones of pathetic eloquence:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Think nothing of me, take no thought for the political
fate of any man whomsoever, but come back to the truths
that are in the Declaration of Independence. You may do
anything with me you choose, if you will but heed these sacred
principles. You may not only defeat me for the Senate,
<i>but you may take me and put me to death</i>. While pretending
no indifference to earthly honors, I do claim to be actuated
in this contest by something higher than an anxiety for
office. I charge you to drop every paltry and insignificant
thought for any man’s success. It is nothing. I am nothing.
Judge Douglas is nothing. <i>But do not destroy that immortal
emblem of humanity, the Declaration of American Independence</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus, at that early day, before war had overshadowed
the land, was he ready for the sacrifice. “Take me and
put me to death,” said he, “but do not destroy that immortal
emblem of humanity, the Declaration of American
Independence.” He has been put to death by the
enemies of the Declaration; but, though dead, he will continue
to guard that great title-deed of the human race.</p>

<p>The debate ended. An immense vote was cast. There
were 126,084 votes for the Republican candidates, 121,940
for the Douglas candidates, and 5,091 for the Lecompton
candidates, another class of Democrats; but the
supporters of Mr. Douglas had a majority of eight on
joint ballot in the Legislature, and he was reëlected to
the Senate.</p>

<p>Again returned to his profession, our champion cherished
the Declaration. To the Republicans of Boston,
who had invited him to unite with them in celebrating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
the birthday of Thomas Jefferson, he sent an answer,
under date of April 6, 1859, which is a gem in political
literature, and here also he asserts the supremacy of
those truths for which he had battled so well. In him
the West spoke to the East, pleading for Human Rights,
as declared by our fathers.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But, soberly, it is now no child’s play to save the principles
of Jefferson from total overthrow in this nation.</p>

<p>“One would state with great confidence that he could convince
any sane child that the simpler propositions of Euclid
are true; but, nevertheless, he would fail utterly with one
who should deny the definitions and axioms. The principles
of Jefferson are the definitions and axioms of free society,
and yet they are denied and evaded with no small show of
success. One dashingly calls them ‘glittering generalities’;
another bluntly calls them ‘self-evident lies’; and others
insidiously argue that they apply only to ‘superior races.’</p>

<p>“These expressions, differing in form, are identical in
object and effect,&mdash;the supplanting the principles of free
government, and restoring those of classification, caste, and
legitimacy. They would delight a convocation of crowned
heads plotting against the people. They are the vanguard,
the miners and sappers, of returning despotism. We must
repulse them, or they will subjugate us.</p>

<p>“This is a world of compensations; and he who would <i>be</i>
no slave must consent to <i>have</i> no slave. Those who deny
freedom to others deserve it not for themselves, and, under
a just God, cannot long retain it.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
<p>“All honor to Jefferson,&mdash;the man who, in the concrete
pressure of a struggle for national independence by a single
people, had the coolness, forecast, and capacity to introduce
into a merely revolutionary document <i>an abstract truth, applicable
to all men and all times</i>, and so to embalm it there,
that to-day, and in all coming days, it shall be a rebuke and
a stumbling-block to the very harbingers of reappearing
tyranny and oppression!”<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Next winter the Western champion appeared at New
York, and in a remarkable address at the Cooper Institute,
February 27, 1860, vindicated the policy of
the Fathers and the principles of the Republican party.
Showing with curious skill and minuteness the original
understanding on the power of Congress over Slavery
in the Territories, he demonstrated that the Republican
party was not in any just sense sectional; and then exposed
the perils from the pretensions of slave-masters,
who, not content with requiring that “we must arrest
and return their fugitive slaves with greedy pleasure,”
insisted that the Constitution must be so interpreted as
to uphold the idea of property in man. The whole address
was subdued and argumentative, while each sentence
was like a driven nail, with a concluding rally
that was a bugle-call to the lovers of right. “Let us
have faith,” said he, “that <i>right makes might</i>, and in
that faith let us to the end dare to do our duty as we
understand it.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A few months later, this champion of the Right, who
would not see the colored man shut out from the promises
of the Declaration, and insisted upon the exclusion
of Slavery from the Territories, after summoning his
countrymen to their duty, was nominated by a great
political party as candidate for President. Local considerations,
securing to him the support of certain States
beyond any other candidate, exercised a final influence
in determining this selection; but it is easy to see
how, from position, character, and origin, he was at that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
moment especially the representative of his country.
The Unity of the Republic was menaced: he was from
that vast controlling Northwest which would never renounce
its communications with the sea, whether by
the Mississippi or by eastern avenues. The birthday
Declaration of the Republic was dishonored in the denial
of its primal truths: he was already known as a
volunteer in its defence. Republican institutions were
in jeopardy: he was the child of humble life, through
whom republican institutions would stand confessed.
These things, so obvious now in the light of history,
were less apparent then in the turmoil of party. But
that Providence in whose hands are the destinies of nations,
which had found out Washington to conduct his
country through the War of Independence, now found
out Lincoln to wage the new battle for the Unity of the
Republic on the foundation of Human Rights.</p>

<p>The election took place. Of the popular votes, Abraham
Lincoln received 1,866,452, carrying 180 electoral
ballots; Stephen A. Douglas received 1,375,157, carrying
12 electoral ballots; John C. Breckinridge received 847,953,
carrying 72 electoral ballots; and John Bell received
590,631, carrying 39 electoral ballots. By this
vote Abraham Lincoln became President. The triumph
at the ballot-box was flashed by telegraph over the
whole country, from north to south, from east to west.
It was answered by defiance from the Slave-Masters,
speaking in the name of State Rights and for the sake
of Slavery. The declared will of the American people,
registered at the ballot-box, was set at nought. The
conspiracy of years blazed into day. The National Government,
which Alexander H. Stephens characterized as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
“the best and freest government, the most equal in its
rights, the most just in its decisions, the most lenient in
its measures, and the most aspiring in its principles to
elevate the race of men, that the sun of heaven ever
shone upon,”<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> and which Jefferson Davis himself pronounced
“the best government which has ever been instituted
by man,”<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>&mdash;that National Government, thus
painted even by its enemies, was spurned. South Carolina
jumped forward first in crime; and before the elected
President turned his face from the beautiful Western
prairies to enter upon his dangerous duties, State after
State had undertaken to abandon its place in the Union,
Senator after Senator had dropped from his seat, fort after
fort had been seized, and the mutterings of war had
begun to fill the air, while the actual President, besotted
by Slavery, tranquilly witnessed the gigantic treason,
as he sat at ease in the Executive Mansion, and did
nothing.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was time for another to come upon the scene.
You cannot forget how he left his village home, never
to return, except under the escort of Death. In words
of farewell to neighbors thronging about him, he dedicated
himself to his country and solemnly invoked the
aid of Divine Providence. “I know not,” he said, “how
soon I shall see you again”; and then, with prophetic
voice, announced that a duty devolved upon him “greater
than that which has devolved upon any other man
since the days of Washington,” and asked his friends to
pray that he might receive that Divine assistance, without
which he could not succeed, but with which success<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
was certain. To power and fame others have gone forth
with gladness and with song: he went forth prayerfully,
as to sacrifice.</p>

<p>Nor can you forget how at each resting-place on the
road he renewed his vows, and when at Independence
Hall his soul broke forth in homage to the vital truths
there declared. Of all that he said on the journey to
the National Capital, after farewell to his neighbors,
there is nothing so prophetic as these unpremeditated
words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All the political sentiments I entertain have been drawn,
so far as I have been able to draw them, from the sentiments
which originated in, and were given to the world from, this
Hall. I have never had a feeling politically that did not
spring from the sentiments embodied in the Declaration of
Independence.… Now, my friends, can this country be
saved upon that basis? If it can, I shall consider myself
one of the happiest men in the world, if I can help to save
it. If it cannot be saved upon that principle, it will be
truly awful. But if this country cannot be saved without
giving up that principle, I was about to say <i>I would rather
be assassinated on this spot than surrender it</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then, after adding that he had not expected to say a
word, he repeated the consecration of his life, exclaiming,
“I have said nothing but what I am willing to live by,
<i>and, if it be the pleasure of Almighty God, to die by</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>He was about to raise the national banner over the
old Hall. But before this service, he took up the strain
he loved so well, saying: “It is on such an occasion as
this that we can reason together, <i>reaffirm our devotion
to the country and the principles of the Declaration of
Independence</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus constantly did he bear testimony. Surely this
grand fidelity will be ever counted among his chief
glories. I know nothing in history more touching, especially
when we consider that this devotion caused
his sacrifice. “Were there as many devils in Worms
as there are tiles upon the roofs, I would enter,”<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> said
Luther. Our reformer was less defiant, but hardly less
determined. Three times had he announced that for
the great truths of the Declaration he was willing to
die; three times had he offered himself on that altar;
three times had he vowed himself to this martyrdom.</p>

<p>Slavery was already pursuing his life. An attempt
was made to throw his train from the track, while a
secreted hand-grenade further betrayed the diabolical
purpose. Baltimore, directly on his way, was the seat
of a murderous plot. Avoiding the conspirators, he came
from Philadelphia to Washington unexpectedly in the
night,&mdash;and thus, for the moment cheating Assassination
of its victim, entered the National Capital.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From this time forward his career broadens into the
history of his country and of the age. You all know it.
Therefore a few glimpses will be enough, that I may
exhibit its moral rather than its story.</p>

<p>The Inaugural Address, the formation of his Cabinet,
his earliest acts, his daily conversation, all attested
the spirit of moderation with which he approached his
perilous position. At the same time he declared openly,
that, in contemplation of universal law and of the
Constitution, the Union of these States is perpetual,&mdash;that
no State, upon its own mere motion, can lawfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
get out of the Union,&mdash;that resolves and ordinances
to that effect are legally void,&mdash;that acts of
violence within any State are insurrectionary or revolutionary,&mdash;and
that, to the extent of his ability, he
should take care, according to express injunction of the
Constitution, that the laws of the Union be faithfully
executed in all the States. While thus positive in upholding
the National Unity, he was resolved that on his
part there should be no act of offence,&mdash;that there
should be no bloodshed or violence, unless forced upon
the country,&mdash;that it was his duty to hold, occupy, and
possess the property and places belonging to the Government,&mdash;but,
beyond what was necessary for this object,
there should be no exercise of force, and the people
everywhere should be left in that perfect security most
favorable to calm thought and reflection.</p>

<p>But the madness of Slavery knew no bound. It was
determined from the beginning that the Union should
be broken, and no moderation could change this wicked
purpose. A pretended power was organized, in the
form of a Confederacy, with Slavery as the declared
corner-stone. You know what ensued. Fort Sumter
was attacked, and, after a fiery storm of shot and shell
for thirty-four hours, the national flag fell. This was
13th April, 1861. War had begun.</p>

<p>War is always a scourge. Never can it be regarded
without sadness. It is one of the mysteries of Providence,
that such an evil is allowed to vex mankind.
Few deprecated it more than the President. From
Quaker blood and from reflection, he was essentially
a man of peace. In one of his speeches during his
short service in Congress, he arraigned military glory
as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span> “that rainbow that rises in showers of blood,&mdash;that
serpent’s eye that charms but to destroy”;<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> and when
charged with the terrible responsibility of Government,
he was none the less earnest for peace. He was not
willing to see his beloved country torn by bloody battle,
with fellow-citizens striking at each other. But after
the criminal assault on Fort Sumter there was no alternative.
The Republic was in peril, and every man,
from President to citizen, was summoned to the defence.
Nor was this all. An attempt was made to invest
Slavery with national independence, and the President,
who disliked both Slavery and War, described
his own condition, when, addressing a member of the
Society of Friends, he said, “Your people have had,
and are having, very great trials. On principle and
faith opposed to both war and oppression, <i>they can only
practically oppose oppression by war</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> In these few
words the whole case is stated,&mdash;inasmuch as, whatever
might be the pretension of State Rights, the war
became necessary to overcome the baleful ambition of
Slavery.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Slave-Masters put in execution a conspiracy
long contrived, for which they had prepared the way,&mdash;first,
by teaching that any State might at its own will
break from the Union, and, secondly, by teaching that
colored persons were so far inferior as not to be embraced
in the promises of the Declaration of Independence,
but were justly held as slaves. The Mephistopheles
of Slavery, Mr. Calhoun, inculcated for years
both these pretensions. But the pretension of State
Rights was a cover for Slavery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p>Therefore, in determining that the Slave-Masters
should be encountered, two things were resolved: first,
that this Republic is one and indivisible; and, secondly,
that no hideous power, with Slavery blazoned on its
front, shall be created on our soil. Here was affirmation
and denial: first, <i>affirmation</i> of the National
Unity; and, secondly, <i>denial</i> of any independent foothold
to Rebel Slavery. Accepting the challenge at
Fort Sumter, the President became the voice of the
Nation, which, with stern resolve, insisted that the Rebellion
should be overcome by war. The people were
in earnest, and would not brook hesitation. If ever
in history war was necessary, if ever in history war
was holy, it was the war then and there begun for the
arrest and overthrow of Rebel Slavery.</p>

<p>The case between the two sides is stated first in the
words of Jefferson Davis, and then in the words of
Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p>The representative of Slavery said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The time for compromise has now passed, and the South
is determined to maintain her position, and make all who
oppose her smell Southern powder and feel Southern steel,
if coercion is persisted in.… Our separation from the old
Union is now complete. No compromise, no reconstruction,
is now to be entertained.”<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Abraham Lincoln said:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In my view of the present aspect of affairs, there need be
no bloodshed or war. I am not in favor of such a course;
and I may say in advance that there will be no bloodshed,
unless it be forced upon the Government, and then it will be
compelled to act in self-defence.”<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And so issue was joined.</p>

<p>It was plain from the first cannon-shot, that the Rebellion
was nothing but Slavery in arms; but such was
the power of Slavery, even in the Free States, that
months elapsed before the giant criminal was directly
assailed. Generals in the field were tender towards it,
as if it were a church, or a work of the fine arts. Only
under the teaching of disaster was the country moved.
The first step in Congress followed the defeat at Bull
Run. Still the President hesitated. Disasters thickened
and graves opened, until at last the country saw
that by justice only could we hope for Divine favor, and
the President, who leaned so closely upon the popular
heart, pronounced that great word by which slaves were
set free. Let it be named forever to his glory, that even
tardily he grasped the thunderbolt under which the Rebellion
staggered to its fall; that, following up the blow,
he enlisted colored citizens as soldiers, and declared his
final purpose never to retract or modify the Emancipation
Proclamation, nor to return into Slavery any person
free by the terms of that instrument, or by any Act
of Congress,&mdash;saying, grandly, “If the people should,
by whatever mode or means, make it an Executive duty
to reënslave such persons, another, and not I, must be
their instrument to perform it.”<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>It is sometimes said that the Proclamation was of
doubtful constitutionality. If such criticism does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
proceed from sympathy with Slavery, it evidently proceeds
from prevailing superstition with regard to this
idol. Future jurists will read with astonishment that
such a flagrant wrong could be considered at any time
as having any rights which a court was bound to respect,
and especially that rebels in arms could be considered
as having any title to the services of people
whose allegiance was primarily due to the United
States. But, turning from these conclusions, it seems
obvious that Slavery, standing exclusively on local law,
without support in natural law, must have fallen with
the local government, both legally and constitutionally:
<i>legally</i>, inasmuch as it ceased to have any valid legal
support; and <i>constitutionally</i>, inasmuch as it came at
once within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Constitution,
where Liberty is the supreme law. The President
did not act upon these principles, but, speaking with
the voice of authority, said, “Let the slaves be free.”
What Court and Congress hesitated to declare he proclaimed,
and thus enrolled himself among the world’s
Emancipators.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From the Proclamation of Emancipation, placing its
author so far above human approach that human envy
cannot reach him, I carry you for one moment to our
Foreign Relations. The convulsion here was felt in the
most distant places,&mdash;as at the great earthquake of Lisbon,
when that capital seemed about to be submerged,
there was commotion of the waters in our Northern
lakes. All Europe was stirred. There, too, was the
Slavery question in another form. In an unhappy moment,
under an ill-considered allegation of “necessity,”&mdash;which
Milton tells us was the plea by which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
Fiend “excused his devilish deeds,”&mdash;England accorded
to Rebel Slavery the rights of belligerence on the ocean,
and then proceeded to open her ports, to surrender her
workshops, and to let loose her merchant ships in aid of
this wickedness: forgetting all relations of alliance and
amity with the United States, forgetting all logic of
English history, forgetting all distinctions of right and
wrong, and forgetting, also, that a New Power founded
on Slavery was a moral monster, with which a just nation
could have nothing to do. To appreciate the character
of this concession, we must comprehend clearly
the whole, vast, unprecedented crime of the Rebellion,
taking its complexion from Slavery. Undoubtedly it
was criminal to assail the Unity of this Republic, and
thus destroy its peace and impair its example in the
world; but the attempt to build a New Power on Slavery
as a corner-stone, and with no other declared object
of separate existence, was more than criminal,&mdash;or
rather it was a crime of that untold, unspeakable
guilt, which no language can depict and no judgment
can be too swift to condemn. The associates in this
terrible apostasy might rebuke each other in the words
of an old dramatist:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>
<p>Recognizing such a power, entering into <i>semi-alliance</i>
with such a power, investing such a power with rights,
opening ports to such a power, surrendering workshops
to such a power, building ships for such a power, driving
a busy commerce with such a power,&mdash;all this, or
any part of this, is positive and plain complicity with
the original guilt, and must be judged as we judge any
other complicity with Slavery. To say that it was a
<i>necessity</i> is only to repeat the perpetual plea by which
slave-masters and slave-traders from the earliest moment
have sought to vindicate their crime. A generous
Englishman, the ornament of letters, from whom we
learn in memorable lines “what constitutes a State,”
has denounced all complicity with Slavery in words
which strike directly at this plea of necessity. “Let
sugar be as dear as it may,” wrote Sir William Jones
to the freeholders of Middlesex, “it is better to eat
none,&mdash;to eat honey, if sweetness only be palatable,&mdash;better
to eat aloes or coloquintida, than violate a primary
law of Nature impressed on every heart not imbruted
by avarice, than rob one human creature of those
eternal rights of which no law upon earth can justly deprive
him.”<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>England led in concession of belligerent rights to
Rebel Slavery. No event of the Rebellion compares
with this, in encouragement to transcendent crime, or
in prejudice to the United States. Out of English
ports and English workshops Rebel Slavery drew its
supplies. In English ship-yards the cruisers of Rebel
Slavery were built and equipped. From English foundries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
and arsenals Rebel Slavery was armed. And all
this was made easy, when her Majesty’s Government,
under pretence of an impossible neutrality, lifted Rebel
Slavery to equality with the National Government, and
gave to it <i>belligerent power</i> on the ocean. The early
legend was verified. King Arthur was without sword,
when suddenly one appeared, thrust out from a lake.
“Lo!” said Merlin, the enchanter, “yonder is that sword
I spake of: it belongeth to the Lady of the Lake, and <i>if
she will, thou mayest take it; but if she will not, it will
not be in thy power to take it</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> And the Lady of the
Lake yielded the sword, so says the legend, even as
England yielded the sword to Rebel Slavery.</p>

<p>The President saw the painful consequence of this
concession, and especially that it was the first step
towards acknowledgment of Rebel Slavery as an Independent
Power. Clearly, if it were proper for a foreign
power to acknowledge Belligerence, it might, at
a later stage, be proper to acknowledge Independence;
and any objection vital to Independence would, if applicable,
be equally vital to Belligerence. Solemn resolutions
of Congress on this question were communicated
to foreign powers;<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> but the unanswerable argument
against any possible recognition of a New Power
founded on Slavery, whether Independent or Belligerent,
was stated by the President in a paper which I
hold in my hand, and which has never before seen the
light. It is a copy of a resolution drawn by himself,
which he consigned to me, in his own autograph, for
transmission to one of our valued friends abroad,<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
an expression of opinion on the great question involved,
and a guide to public duty.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Whereas</i>, while <i>heretofore</i> states and nations have tolerated
Slavery, <i>recently</i>, for the first [time] in the world, an
attempt has been made to construct a New Nation upon the
basis of Human Slavery, and with the primary and fundamental
object to maintain, enlarge, and perpetuate the same:
Therefore</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That no such embryo state should ever be
recognized by or admitted into the family of Christian and
civilized nations, and that all Christian and civilized men
everywhere should by all lawful means resist to the utmost
such recognition or admission.”</p>

</div>

<p>Observe how distinctly any recognition of Rebel Slavery
as an Independent Power is branded, and how “all
Christian and civilized men everywhere” are summoned
to “resist to the utmost such recognition”; and precisely
for the same reason such “Christian and civilized
men everywhere” should have resisted to the utmost
any recognition of Rebel Slavery as a Belligerent
Power. Had this benign spirit entered into the
counsels of England when Slavery first took arms, this
great historic nation would have shrunk at all hazard
from that fatal concession, in itself a plain contribution
to Slavery, and opening the way to infinite contributions,
without which the criminal pretender must have
speedily succumbed. There would have been no plea
of “necessity.” But Divine Providence willed it otherwise.
Perhaps it was essential to the full revelation of
its boundless capacities, that the Republic should stand
forth alone, in sublime solitude, warring for Human
Rights, and thus become an example to mankind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the war continued with proverbial vicissitudes.
Battles were fought and lost. Other battles
were fought and won. Rebel Slavery stood face to face
in deadly conflict with the Declaration of Independence,
when the President, with unconscious power, dealt another
blow, second only to the Proclamation of Emancipation.
This was at the blood-soaked field of Gettysburg,
where the armies of the Republic encountered
the armies of Slavery, and, after a conflict of three days,
drove them back with destructive slaughter,&mdash;as at that
decisive battle of Tours, on which hung the destinies of
Christianity in Western Europe, the invading Mahometans,
after prolonged conflict, were driven back by
Charles “the Hammer.” No battle of the present war
was more important. Few battles in history compare
with it. A brief space later occurred another meeting
on that same field. It was of grateful fellow-citizens,
gathered from all parts of the Union for its consecration
to the memory of those who had fallen there.
Eminent men of our own country and from foreign
lands united in the service. There, too, was your classic
orator,<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> whose finished address was a model of literary
excellence. The President spoke very briefly; but his
few words will live as long as Time. Since Simonides
wrote the epitaph for those who died at Thermopylæ,
nothing equal has ever been breathed over the fallen
dead. Thus he began: “Fourscore and seven years ago
our fathers brought forth upon this continent a New
Nation, <i>conceived in Liberty and dedicated to the proposition
that all men are created equal</i>.” How grandly,
and yet simply, is the New Nation announced, with the
Equality of All Men as its frontlet! The truths of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
Declaration, so often proclaimed by him, and for which
he was willing to die, are inscribed on the altar of the
slain, while the country is summoned to their support,
that our duty may not be left undone.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is for us, the living, rather to be dedicated here to the
<i>unfinished work</i> which they who fought here have thus far so
nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to
the great task remaining before us; that from these honored
dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they
gave the last full measure of devotion; that we here highly
resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain; that
this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of Freedom;
and that government of the people, by the people, and for
the people, shall not perish from the earth.”<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

</div>

<p>That speech, uttered at the field of Gettysburg, and
now sanctified by the martyrdom of its author, is a
monumental act. In the modesty of his nature, he said:
“The world will little note, nor long remember, what we
say here; but it can never forget what they did here.”<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
He was mistaken. The world noted at once what he
said, and will never cease to remember it. The battle
itself was less important than the speech. Ideas are
more than battles.</p>

<p>Among events assuring to him the general confidence
against all party clamor and prejudice, this speech cannot
be placed too high. To some who doubted his earnestness
it was touching proof of their error. Others
who followed with indifference were warmed with grateful
sympathy. Many felt its exquisite genius, as well
as lofty character. There were none to criticize.</p>

<p>His reëlection was not only a personal triumph, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
a triumph of the Republic. For himself personally, it
was much to find his administration ratified; but for
republican ideas it was of incalculable value that at
such a time the plume of the soldier had not prevailed.
In the midst of war, the people at the ballot-box deliberately
selected the civilian. Ye who doubt the destinies
of the Republic, who fear the ambition of a military
chief, or suspect the popular will, do not forget
that at this moment, when the noise of battle filled the
whole land, the country quietly appointed for its ruler
this man of peace.</p>

<p>The Inaugural Address which signalized his entry for
a second time upon his great duties was briefer than
any in our history; but it has already gone further, and
it will live longer, than any other. It was a continuation
of the Gettysburg speech, with the same sublimity
and gentleness. Its concluding words were like an
angelic benediction.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now there was surfeit of battle and of victory.
Calmly he saw the land of Slavery enveloped by the
national forces,&mdash;saw the great coil bent by his generals
about it,&mdash;saw the mighty <i>garrote</i>, as it tightened
against the neck of the Rebellion. Good news came
from all quarters. Everywhere the army was doing its
duty. One was conquering in Tennessee; another was
advancing in Georgia and Carolina; another was watching
at Richmond. The navy echoed back the thunders
of the army. Place after place was falling,&mdash;Savannah,
Charleston, Fort Fisher, Wilmington. The President
left the National Capital to be near the Lieutenant-General.
Then came the capture of Petersburg and
Richmond, with the flight of Jefferson Davis and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
Cabinet. Without pomp or military escort, the President
entered the Capital of the Rebellion, and walked
its streets, from which Slavery had fled forever. Then
came the surrender of Lee; that of Johnston was at
hand. The military power of Rebel Slavery was broken
like a Prince-Rupert’s drop, and everywhere within its
confines the barbarous government tumbled in crash
and ruin. The country was in ecstasy. All this he
beheld without elation, while his soul was brooding
on thoughts of peace and clemency. On the morning
of Friday, 14th April, his youthful son, who had been
on the staff of the Lieutenant-General, returned to resume
his interrupted studies. The father was happy
in the sound of his footsteps, and felt the augury of
peace. During the same day the Lieutenant-General
returned. In the intimacy of his family the President
said, “This day the war is over.” In the evening he
sought relaxation, and you know the rest. Alas! the
war was not over. The minions of Slavery were dogging
him with unabated animosity, and that night he
became a martyr.</p>

<p>The country rose at once in agony of grief, and
everywhere strong men wept. City, town, and village
were darkened by the general obsequies. Every street
was draped. Only ensigns of woe were seen. He had
become, as it were, the inmate of every house, and the
families of the land were in mourning. Not in the
Executive mansion only, but in uncounted homes, was
his vacant chair. Never before such universal sorrow.
Already the voice of lamentation is returning from
Europe, where candor towards him had begun even
before his tragical death. A short time ago he was
unknown, except in his own State. A short time ago<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
he visited New York as a stranger, and was shown
about its streets by youthful companions. Five years
later he was borne through those streets with funeral
pomp such as the world never witnessed before. Space
and speed were forgotten in the offering of hearts; and
as the surpassing pageant, with more than “sceptred
pall,” moved on iron highways, over Counties and States,
from ocean-side to prairie, the whole afflicted people
bowed their uncovered heads.</p>

<p>It was hard to comprehend this blow, and many cried
in despair. But the rule of God is too visible to allow
doubt of His constant presence. Did not our martyr
in his last address remind us that the judgments of
the Lord are true and righteous altogether? And who
will say that his death was not a judgment of the
Lord? Perhaps it was needed to lift the country into
a more perfect justice and to inspire a sublimer faith.
Perhaps it was sent in love, to set a sacred, irreversible
seal upon the good he had done, and to put Emancipation
beyond all mortal question. Perhaps it was
the sacrificial consecration of those primal truths embodied
in the birthday Declaration of the Republic,
which he had so often vindicated, and for which he
had announced his willingness to die.</p>

<p>He is gone, and he has been mourned sincerely.
Only private sorrow would recall the dead. He is now
removed beyond earthly vicissitudes. Life and death
are both past. He had been happy in life: he was
not less happy in death. In death, as in life, he was
still under the guardianship of that Divine Providence,
which, taking him early by the hand, led him from
obscurity to power and fame. The blow was sudden,
but not unprepared for. Only on the Sunday preceding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
as he was coming from the front on board the
steamer, with a beautiful quarto Shakespeare in his
hands, he read aloud the well-remembered words of
his favorite “Macbeth”:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent10">“Duncan is in his grave;</div>
<div class="verse">After life’s fitful fever, he sleeps well.</div>
<div class="verse">Treason has done his worst; nor steel, nor poison,</div>
<div class="verse">Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,</div>
<div class="verse">Can touch him further.”<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Impressed by their beauty, or by some presentiment
unuttered, he read them aloud a second time. As the
friends about listened to his reading, they little thought
how in a few days what was said of the murdered
Duncan would be said of him. “Nothing can touch him
further.” He is saved from the trials that were gathering.
He had fought the good fight of Emancipation.
He had borne the brunt of war with embattled hosts,
and conquered. He had made the name of Republic
a triumph and a joy in foreign lands. Now that the
strife of blood was ended, it remained to be seen how
he could confront those machinations which are only
<i>prolongation of the war</i>, and more dangerous because
more subtle,&mdash;where recent Rebels, with professions of
Union on the lips, but still denying the birthday Declaration
of the Republic, vainly seek to organize peace
on <i>another Oligarchy of the skin</i>. From all these trials
he was saved. But his testimony lives, and will live
forever, speaking by his life, speaking yet again by his
death. Invisible to mortal sight, and now above all
human weakness, he is still champion, as in his early
conflict, summoning his countrymen <i>back to the truths
in the Declaration of Independence</i>. Dead, he speaks
with more than living voice. But the author of Emancipation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
cannot die. His immortality on earth has
begun. Country and age are already enshrined in his
example, as if he were the great poet gathered to his
fathers.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Back to the living hath he turned him,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And all of death has passed away;</div>
<div class="verse">The age that thought him dead and mourned him</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Itself now lives but in his lay.”<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>If the President were on earth, he would protest
against any monotony of panegyric. He never exaggerated.
He was always cautious in praise, as in censure.
In endeavor to estimate his character, we shall
be nearer him in proportion as we cultivate the same
spirit.</p>

<p>In person he was tall and bony, with little resemblance
to any historic portrait, unless he might seem
in one respect to justify the epithet given to an early
English king.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> As he stood, his form was angular, with
something of that straightness in lines so peculiar in
the figure of Dante by Flaxman. His countenance had
more of rugged strength than his person, and, while in
repose, inclined to sadness; yet it lighted easily. Perhaps
the quality that struck most at first was his constant
simplicity of manner and conversation, without
form or ceremony beyond that among neighbors. His
handwriting had the same simplicity. It was clear as
that of Washington, but less florid. Each had been
surveyor, and was perhaps indebted to this experience.
But the son of the Western pioneer was more simple
in nature, and the man appeared in the autograph. An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
integrity which has become a proverb belonged to the
same quality. The most perfect honesty must be the
most perfect simplicity. Words by which an ancient
Roman was described picture him,&mdash;“<i>Vita innocentissimus,
proposito sanctissimus</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> He was naturally humane,
inclined to pardon, and never remembered hard
things against himself. He was always good to the
poor, and in dealings with them was full of those “kind
little words which are of the same blood as great and
holy deeds.” On the Saturday before his death I saw
him shake hands with more than five thousand soldier
patients in the tent-hospitals at City Point, and he told
me afterwards that his arm was not tired. Such a character
awakened the instinctive sympathy of the people.
They saw his fellow-feeling, and felt the kinship. With
him as President, the idea of Republican Institutions,
where no place is too high for the humblest, was perpetually
apparent; so that his simple presence was like
a Proclamation of Human Equality.</p>

<p>While social in nature and enjoying the flow of conversation,
he was often reticent. Modesty was natural
to such a character. Without affectation, so was
he without pretension or jealousy. No person, civil
or military, complains that he appropriated to himself
any honor belonging to another. To each and all he
gave the credit that was due. And this same spirit
appeared in smaller things. In a sally of Congressional
debate, he exclaimed, that a fiery slave-master
of Georgia, who had just spoken, was “an eloquent
man, and a man of learning, so far as he could judge,
not being learned himself.”<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>
<p>His humor, like his integrity, has become a proverb.
Sometimes he insisted that he had no invention, but
only memory. Good things heard he did not forget,
and he was never without a familiar story. When he
spoke, the recent West seemed to vie with the ancient
East in apologue and fable. His ideas moved, as the
beasts entered Noah’s ark, in pairs. His illustrations
had a homely felicity, and seemed not less important
to him than the argument, which he always enforced
with a certain emphasis of manner and voice. This
same humor was often displayed where there was no
story, and with a point that might recall Franklin. I
know not how the indifference to Slavery exhibited by
so many could be exposed more effectively than when
he said of a political antagonist thus offending, “I suppose
the institution of Slavery really looks small to him.
He is so put up by nature, that a lash upon his back
would hurt him, but a lash upon anybody else’s back
does not hurt him.” And then again there is a bit of
reply to Mr. Douglas, most characteristic not only for
humor, but as showing how little at that time he was
looking to the great place he reached so soon afterwards.
“Senator Douglas,” said he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span> “is of world-wide
renown. All the anxious politicians of his party, or
who have been of his party for years past, have been
looking upon him as certainly, at no distant day, to be
the President of the United States. They have seen
in his round, jolly, fruitful face post-offices, land-offices,
marshalships and cabinet appointments, chargéships
and foreign missions, bursting and sprouting out in
wonderful exuberance, ready to be laid hold of by their
greedy hands.… <i>On the contrary, nobody has ever expected
me to be President.</i> In my poor, lean, lank face
nobody has ever seen that any cabbages were sprouting
out. These are disadvantages, all taken together, that
the Republicans labor under. We have to fight this battle
upon principle, and upon principle alone.”<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> Here is
a glimpse of himself, as honorable as curious. In a different
vein, he said, while President, “The United States
Government must not undertake to run the churches.”<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>
Here wisdom and humor vie with each other.</p>

<p>He was original in mind as in character. His style
was his own, having no model, but springing directly
from himself. Failing often in correctness, it is sometimes
unique in beauty and sentiment. There are passages
which will live always. It is no exaggeration to
say, that, in weight and pith, suffused in a certain poetical
color, they call to mind Bacon’s Essays. Theirs also
was a touching reality and unconscious power, without
form or apparent effort. Nothing similar can be found
in state-papers. How poor are kings’ speeches and Presidential
messages by the side of such utterances, fit harbingers
of the sublime era of Humanity!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>He was placed by Providence at the head of his
country during an unprecedented crisis, when the fountains
of the great deep were broken up, and men turned
for protection to military power. Multitudinous armies
were mustered. Great navies were created. Of all these
he was constitutional commander-in-chief. As the war
proceeded, prerogatives enlarged and others sprang into
being, until the sway of a Republican President became
imperatorial, imperial. But not for one moment did the
modesty of his nature desert. His constant thought was
his country, and how to serve it. He saw the certain
greatness of the Republic, and was pleased in looking
forward to that early day, when, according to assured
calculation, its millions of people will count by the hundred;
but this prodigious sway was commended to him
only by the good of man. Personal ambition at the
expense of patriotism was as far removed from the simple
purity of his nature as poison from a strawberry.
And thus, with equal courage in the darkest hours, he
continued on, heeding as little the warnings of danger
as the temptations of power. “It would not do
for a President,” he said, “to have guards with drawn
sabres at his door, as if he fancied he were, or were
trying to be, or were assuming to be, an Emperor.” In
the same homeliness he spoke of his morning return
to daily duty as “opening shop.” Though commissioning
officers in multitudes beyond any other person of
authentic history, he never learned the mystery of
shoulder-straps or of buttons in the military and naval
uniforms, except that he noticed three stars on the
shoulders of the Lieutenant-General.</p>

<p>When he became President, he was without any considerable
experience in public affairs; nor was he much
versed in history, whose lessons would have been valuable.
Becoming more familiar with the place, his facility
increased. He had “learned the ropes,” so he said.
But his habits of business were irregular, and never
those of despatch. He did not see at once the just
proportions of things, and allowed himself to be occupied
by details. Even in small affairs, as well as great,
there was in him a certain resistance to be overcome.
Moments occurred when this delay excited impatience,
and the transcendent question seemed to suffer. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
when the blow fell, there was nothing but gratitude,
and all confessed the singleness with which he sought
the public good. A conviction prevailed, that, though
slow to reach his conclusion, he was inflexible in maintaining
it. Pompey boasted that by the stamp of his
foot he could raise an army. The President did this by
a word, and more: according to his own saying, he “put
his foot down,” and saved a principle.</p>

<p>This firmness in the right, as he saw it, was an anchor
which held always. Emancipation, once adopted, was
safe against recall or change. From time to time his
determination was repeated in terms which awakened a
throb in every liberty-loving bosom,&mdash;as when, in the
summer before the Presidential election, in his letter
“To whom it may concern,” he announced “the abandonment
of Slavery” as an essential condition of peace,<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>
and thus again proclaimed Emancipation,&mdash;or when,
on another occasion, he said, in simple words, “And
the promise, being made, must be kept,”<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>&mdash;and then
again exclaimed, loftily, in words good to repeat, “If
the people should, by whatever mode or means, make it
an Executive duty to reënslave such persons, another,
and not I, must be their instrument to perform it.”<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
All this was beautiful and grand. Sodom was burning,
but there was no disposition to look back.</p>

<p>In statement of moral truth and exposure of wrong
he was at times singularly cogent. There was fire as
well as light in his words. Nobody more clearly exhibited
Slavery in its enormity. On one occasion, he
branded it as a “monstrous injustice”; on another, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
pictured the slave-masters as “wringing their bread
from the sweat of other men’s faces”; and then, on
still another, he said, with fine simplicity of diction,
“If Slavery is not wrong, then nothing is wrong.”
Would you find condemnation more complete, you must
go to John Brown, or to those famous words of John
Wesley, where the great Methodist held up Slavery as
the “execrable sum of all villanies.” Another mind,
more submissive to the truth he recognized, and less
disposed to take counsel of to-morrow, would have
hesitated less in carrying this judgment forward to its
natural conclusion. His courage to apply truth was
not always equal to his clearness in seeing it. The
heights he gained in conscience were not always sustained
in conduct. And have we not been told that
the soul can gain heights it cannot keep? Thus, while
condemning Slavery, he still waited, till many feared
that with him judgment would “lose the name of action.”
Even while exalting Human Equality, assailed
and derided by one of our ablest debaters, and insisting,
with admirable constancy, that all, without distinction
of color, are within the birthday promises of the
Republic, he yet allowed himself to be pressed by his
adversary to an illogical limitation of political rights.
But he was willing at all times to learn, and not
ashamed to change. Before death he expressed a desire
that suffrage should be accorded to colored persons
in certain cases; yet here again he failed to apply the
great Declaration for which he so often contended. If
suffrage be accorded to colored persons only in certain
cases, then, of course, it can be accorded to whites only
in the same cases,&mdash;or Equality ceases.</p>

<p>It was his own frank confession that he had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
controlled events, but they had controlled him. At
the important stages of the war, he followed rather
than led. The people, under God, were masters. Let
it not be forgotten that the national triumphs, and even
Emancipation itself, sprang from the great heart of the
American people. Individual services have been important,
but there is no man who was necessary.</p>

<p>On one theme he inclined latterly to guide the public
mind: it was the treatment of the Rebel leaders.
His policy was never announced, and of course would
have been subject to modification always in the light
of experience. But it is known that at the moment of
his assassination he was occupied by thoughts of lenity
and pardon. He was never harsh, even in speaking of
Jefferson Davis; and only a few days before his end,
when one who was privileged to address him in that
way said, “Do not allow him to escape the law, he
must be hanged,” the President replied calmly, in the
words so beautifully adopted in his last Inaugural Address,
“Judge not, that ye be not judged”; and when
pressed again by the remark that the sight of Libby
Prison made it impossible to pardon him, the President
repeated twice over the same words. The question of
clemency to our Rebels is the very theme so ably debated
between Cæsar and Cato, while the Roman Senate
was considering how to treat the confederates of
Catiline. Cæsar consented to confiscation and imprisonment,
but pleaded for life. Cato was sterner. It is
probable that the President, who was a Cato in patriotism,
would have followed the counsels of Cæsar.</p>

<p>Good-will to all men was with him a science as well
as a sentiment. His nature was pacific, and throughout
the terrible conflict his thoughts were always turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
on peace. He wished peace among ourselves, and he
wished peace with foreign powers. While abounding
in gratitude to returned officers and men, who had
fought the national battle so well, he longed to see the
sword in its scabbard, never again to flash against the
sky. His prudence found expression in the saying,
“One war at a time”; but his whole nature seemed to
say, “Peace always.” And yet it was his fortune to
conduct one of the greatest wars in all time. “With
malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness
in the right, as God gives us to see the right,”<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>&mdash;so he
worked and lived; and these words of his own might
be his honest epitaph.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>His place in history may be seen from the transcendent
events with which his name must be forever
associated. The pyramids of our country are built by
the people more than by any ruler; but the ruler of
the people at such a moment cannot be forgotten.</p>

<p>It is impossible to exaggerate the Proclamation of
Emancipation as an historic event. Its influence cannot
be limited to the present in place or time. It will
reach beyond the national jurisdiction, and beyond the
present age. Besides its immediate efficacy in liberating
slaves at home, it rises already a landmark of Human
Progress. From the solidarity of Slavery, the fall
of this abomination among us must cause its fall everywhere,&mdash;so
that in Cuba, Porto Rico, Brazil, or wherever
else a slave now wears a chain, that Proclamation will
be felt. Proudly will it be recognized always in the
destinies of the Republic. Only a short time before,
the Czar of Russia, also by proclamation, raised twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
millions of serfs to the dignity of freemen; but even
this eminent act was less historic. Though of incalculable
importance to the serfs, it was not the triumph
of Popular Government, and it came from the East instead
of the West. It is to the West that the world
now looks for sunrise. “<i>Video solem orientem in occidente.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>
But the Emancipation Proclamation itself was
an agency in the military overthrow of the Rebellion,
which, if regarded as an achievement of war, is one of
the greatest in the annals of war, but, if regarded in
political consequences, is an epoch of history. Here,
again, the magnitude of the event is fully appreciated
only when it is considered that the triumph of the
Republic is the triumph of Popular Institutions everywhere.
It is much that the Republic has become impregnable,
whether against “malice domestic” or “foreign
levy”; but it is more that it has become an example
to the world. That all this should be done under
a President representing especially the people, speaking
always in sympathy with the people in words of power
never to be forgotten, and sealing his devotion with life,
adds to the splendor of the example.</p>

<p>His are great heralds, such as few have had as they
entered the lofty portals. Our martyred dead is seen
also in the company to which he is admitted, among
the purest of all time,&mdash;martyrs, patriots, philanthropists,
servants of truth and duty. Milton, Hampden,
Sidney, Wilberforce, all welcome the new-comer. Washington
leads the hosts of his own country, from the
Pilgrims of the Mayflower to the thronging crowds who
have laid down their lives for the Republic.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>
<p>By the association of a similar death he passes into
the same galaxy with Cæsar, William of Orange, and
Henry the Fourth of France, all of whom were assassinated,&mdash;and
his star will not pale by the side of
theirs. Cæsar was a contrast in everything, unless in
clemency, and the coincidence that each at the time
of sacrifice was fifty-six years of age. How unlike
in all else! Cæsar was of brilliant lineage, which he
traced on one side to the immortal gods, and on the
other to a recent chief of Rome,&mdash;of completest
education,&mdash;of amplest means,&mdash;of rarest experience,&mdash;of
acknowledged genius as statesman, soldier, orator,
and writer, being in himself the most finished man
of Antiquity; but he was the enslaver of his country,
whose personal ambition took the place of patriotism,
and whose name has become the synonym of
imperial power. Of princely birth and great riches,
William of Orange began as page in the household of
Charles the Fifth, on whose wide-spread dominions,
the largest of modern history, the sun never set. The
youthful page became companion and intimate of the
powerful Emperor. Unawed and unseduced, he upheld
the liberties of his country, which he conducted
wisely, surely, grandly,&mdash;anticipating the example
of Washington. His name of “Silent” suggests the
reticence of his American parallel, like whom he was
also a liberator. Henry the Fourth, of the House of
Bourbon, was a king memorable for practical sense,
anecdote, and pregnant wit, with a certain Gallic salt.
He, too, knew the trials of civil war, which he closed
in peace and crowned with mercy. The National Unity
prevailed in him. The age of fifty-six witnessed also
his death, leaving great plans unfulfilled, and his career<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
emblazoned by the popular epic of his country, “La
Henriade” of Voltaire. These are illustrious names;
but there is nothing in them to eclipse the simple life
of our President, whose example, commemorated by
history and by song, will be the pride of humanity
and a rebuke to every usurper. The cause he served
was more than empire. The motive of his conduct was
higher than success,&mdash;as devotion to Human Rights is
higher than genius or power, as man is higher than
aught else on earth.</p>

<p>More like him in certain aspects was the Roman
Emperor Vespasian, whose just sway was prolonged in
Titus, his son. Without ancestry or rank, he rose to
the loftiest power, and, when on these heights, never
dissembled the humility of his origin. The simplicity
and frugality of early life were continued on the throne
of the world. There was in the Emperor a kindred
humanity, and the same fondness for story and jest.
But the common feature, bringing the two into one historic
family, was generous indulgence to political opponents.
It belongs to the fame of our President that in
selections for the public service he forgot all personal
differences. Capacity and devotion to the country
were controlling recommendations, before which every
thought of opposition or rivalry, or even of injury, disappeared.
Here the Roman Emperor anticipated the
American President; for the contemporary historian, in
his brief record, presents him as “very little mindful of
affronts and enmities, or vindictive on their account.”<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>
Such a character, whether at Rome or Washington, is
an example for all.</p>

<p>There is another character, taken away close upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
the age of fifty-six,<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> who seems to have revived in the
President. Do not be astonished, when I mention St.
Louis of France. Difference of epoch and of objects
occupying attention cannot obscure certain kindred features,
and especially the common consecration of their
lives. The French monarch, though at the head of a
military power, was a lover of peace, and cultivated
justice towards his neighbors. Through him a barbarous
institution was overthrown, and France advanced
in civilization. The Trial by Battle, against which he
launched a noble ordinance, was a curse not inferior
to our Slavery. In an age of violence he was gentle.
In an age of privilege, and wearing a crown, he
was moved to the practice of Equality. History recalls
with undisguised applause the simple justice he
delighted to administer, sitting under an oak in the
park of Vincennes. Our President launched his ordinance
at a barbarous institution, and advanced his country.
He, too, practised Equality. And he, also, had his
oak of Vincennes. It was that plain room where he
was always so accessible as to make his example difficult
for future Presidents. At stated times he was open
to all who came with petitions, and they flocked across
the continent. The transactions of that simple court of
last resort would show how much was done to temper
the law, to assuage sorrow, and to care for the widow
and orphan; but its only record is in heaven.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such, fellow-citizens, are the Life and Character of
Abraham Lincoln. You have discerned his simple beginnings,&mdash;have
watched his early struggles,&mdash;have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
gratefully followed his dedication to the truths our
fathers declared,&mdash;have hailed him twice-elected head
of the Republic, through whom it was known in foreign
lands,&mdash;have recognized him at a period of national
peril as representative of the <i>unfulfilled promises</i>
made by our fathers, even as Washington was
representative of National Independence,&mdash;and you
have beheld him struck down at the moment of victory,
when Rebel Slavery was everywhere succumbing.
Reverently we acknowledge the finger of the Almighty,
and pray that our great trials may not fail, to the end
that the promises of the Fathers may be fulfilled,&mdash;those
promises, so great and glorious, which make the
Declaration a title-deed of mankind.</p>

<p>Traitorous Assassination struck him down. Yet be
not vindictive towards the poor atom that held the
weapon. Reserve your rage for the responsible power,
which, not content with assailing the life of the Republic,
outraged all law, human and divine,&mdash;organized
Barbarism as a principle of conduct,&mdash;took the
lives of faithful Unionists at home,&mdash;prepared robbery
and murder on the northern borders,&mdash;fired hotels,
the home of women and children,&mdash;plotted to scatter
pestilence and poison,&mdash;perpetrated piracy and ship-burning
at sea,&mdash;starved American citizens in prolonged
captivity,&mdash;inflicted the slow torture of Andersonville
and Libby,&mdash;menaced assassination always,&mdash;and
now, at last, true to itself, has assassinated our
President: and this responsible power is none other
than Slavery. It is Slavery that has taken the life of
our beloved Chief Magistrate; and here is another triumph
of its Barbarism. On Slavery let vengeance fall.
Spare, if you please, the worm it employs; but do not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
I entreat you, yield amnesty to this murderous wickedness.
Ravaillac, who took the life of the French
Henry, was torn in pieces on the public square before
the City Hall by four powerful horses, each fastened
to one of his limbs, and rending in opposite directions,
until, at last, after fearful struggle, nothing of
the wretched assassin remained to the executioner except
his bloody shirt, which was at once handed over
to be burned. Such be our vengeance; and let Slavery
be the victim.</p>

<p>And not only Slavery, which is another name for
property in man, but also that other pretension, not
less irrational and hateful, that Human Rights can
depend on color. This is the bloody shirt of the assassin;
let it be handed over to be burned.</p>

<p>Such a vengeance will be a kiss of reconciliation;
for it will remove every obstacle to peace and harmony.
The people where Slavery once ruled will bless
the blow that destroyed it. The people where the kindred
tyranny of Caste once prevailed will rejoice that
this fell under the same blow. They will yet confess
that it was dealt in no harshness, in no unkindness, in
no desire to humiliate, but simply and solemnly, in
the name of the Republic and of Human Nature, for
their good as well as ours,&mdash;ay, for their good more
than ours.</p>

<p>By ideas, more than by armies, we have conquered.
The sword of the Archangel was less mighty than
the mission he bore from the Lord. But if the ideas
giving us the victory are now neglected, if the pledges
of the Declaration, which the Rebellion openly assailed,
are left unredeemed, then have blood and treasure
been lavished for nought. Alas for the dead who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
gave themselves so bravely to their country, alas for
the living left to mourn the dead, if any relic of Slavery
is allowed to continue!&mdash;especially if this bloody imposture,
defeated in the pretension of property in man,
is allowed to perpetuate an oligarchy of the skin!</p>

<p>How shall these ideas be saved? How shall the
war waged by Abraham Lincoln be brought to an end,
so as to assure peace, tranquillity, and reconciliation?
All turns on the colored suffrage. This is the centre
and pivot of national safety. A mistake now is worse
than the loss of a battle. And yet here again we encounter
the Rebellion in its odious pretensions, hardly
less audacious than when it took up arms. Amidst its
expiring camp-fires, the men who have trimmed them&mdash;with
fresh oaths of allegiance on the lips&mdash;renew
their early activity in plotting how to preserve an
oligarchical power. The demon of Caste follows the
demon of Slavery. In setting ourselves against this
accursed succession, we follow the solemn behests of
the Great Declaration, so constantly championed by
the martyred President. And now, as I close this humble
tribute, let me ask you to adopt that championship,
which was his first title to national gratitude, and
is now his best. Let each be standard-bearer of the
Declaration. I cannot err, if, speaking at his funeral,
I detain you to insist upon this absorbing duty, where
for the moment all other duties are swallowed up.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The argument for colored suffrage is overwhelming.
It springs from the necessity of the case, as well as
from the Rights of Man. This suffrage is needed for
the security of the colored people, for the stability
of the local government, and for the strength of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
Union. Without it there is nothing but insecurity for
the colored people, instability for the local government,
and weakness for the Union, involving of course
the national credit. Without it the Rebellion will break
forth under a new <i>alias</i>, unarmed it may be, but with
white votes to take possession of the local government
and wield it at will, whether at home or in the national
councils. If it be said that the colored people
are unfit, then do I show that they are more fit than
their recent masters, or than the “poor whites.” They
have been loyal always; and who is he, that, under
any pretence, exalts the prejudices of the disloyal above
the rights of the loyal? Their suffrage is now needed,&mdash;more
even than you ever needed their muskets or
sabres. An English statesman, after the acknowledgment
of the Spanish Colonies as Independent States,
boasted that he had called a new world into existence
to redress the balance of the old. In similar spirit, we,
too, must call a new ballot into existence to redress
the tyranny that refuses justice to the colored race.</p>

<p>The same national authority that destroyed Slavery
must see that this other pretension is not permitted
to survive; nor is there any doubt that the authority
which destroyed Slavery is competent to the kindred
duty. Each belongs to that great policy of justice
through which alone can peace become permanent
and immutable. Nor may the Republic shirk this remaining
service, without leaving Emancipation unfinished
and the early promises of the Fathers unfulfilled.
Vain the gift of Liberty, if you surrender the rights of
the freedman to be judged by recent assertors of property
in man. Burke, in his day, saw the flagrant inconsistency,
and denounced it, saying that whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
such people did on this subject was “arrant trifling,”
and, notwithstanding its plausible form, always wanted
what he aptly called “the executory principle.”<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> These
words of warning were adopted and repeated by two
later statesmen, George Canning and Henry Brougham;
but they are so clear as not to need support of names.
The infant must not be handed over to be suckled by
the wolf; it must be carefully nursed by its parent;
and since the Republic is parent of Emancipation, the
Republic must nurse the immortal infant into maturity
and strength. The Republic at the beginning took
up this great work: the Republic must finish what it
began; and it cannot err, if, in anxious care, it holds
nothing done so long as anything remains undone. The
Republic, with matchless energy, hurled forward victorious
armies: the Republic must exact that “security
for the future” without which this unparalleled war
will have been waged in vain. The Republic to-day,
with one consenting voice, commemorates the martyred
victim: the same Republic, prompt in this service,
must require that his promises to an oppressed race
be maintained in all their integrity and completeness,
in letter and in spirit, so that the cause for which he
became a sacrifice shall not fail; his martyrdom was a
new pledge, beyond any even in life.</p>

<p>The colored suffrage is an overwhelming necessity.
In making it an essential condition of restoration, we
follow, first, the law of reason and of Nature, and,
secondly, the Constitution, not only in its text, but
in the light of the Declaration. By reason and Nature
there can be no denial of rights on account of color;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
and we can do nothing thus irrational and unnatural.
By the Constitution it is stipulated that “the United
States shall guaranty to every State <i>a republican form
of government</i>”; but the meaning of this guaranty must
be found in the birthday Declaration of the Republic,
which is the controlling preamble of the Constitution.
Beyond all question, the United States, when called to
enforce the guaranty, must insist on <i>the equality of all
before the law</i>, and <i>the consent of the governed</i>. Such is
the true idea of republican government according to
American institutions.</p>

<p>The Slave-Masters, driven from their first intrenchments,
occupy inner defences. Property in man is
abandoned; but they now insist that the freedman
shall not enjoy political rights. Liberty has been won.
The battle for Equality is still pending. And now a
new compromise is proposed, in the name of State
Rights. Sad that it should be so. But I do not despair.
The victory may be delayed, but not lost. All
who set themselves against Equality will be overborne;
for it is the cause of Humanity. Not the rich and
proud, but the poor and lowly, will be the favorites of
an enfranchised Republic. The words of the Prophet
must be fulfilled: “And I will punish the world for
their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I
will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and
will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible. I WILL
MAKE A MAN MORE PRECIOUS THAN FINE
GOLD, EVEN A MAN, THAN THE GOLDEN
WEDGE OF OPHIR.”<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> I accept these sublime
promises, and echo them back as assurance of triumph.
Then will the Republic be all that heart can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
desire or imagination paint,&mdash;“<i>supremely lovely and
serenely great, majestic mother</i>” of a free, happy, and
united people, with Slavery and all its tyranny beaten
down under foot, so that no man shall call another
master, and all shall be equal before the law.</p>

<p>In this great victory death is swallowed up, and
before us is the vision of the Republic performing all
that was promised. How easy, then, the passage from
sorrow to exultation!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Fellow-citizens, be happy in what you have. Mourn
not the dead, but rejoice in his life and example. Rejoice,
as you point to this child of the people, who was
lifted so high that Republican Institutions became manifest
in him. Rejoice that through him Emancipation
was proclaimed. Rejoice that under him “government
of the people, by the people, and for the people” obtained
a final verdict never to be set aside or questioned.
Above all, see to it that his constant vows are
performed, and the promises of the Fathers maintained,
so that no person in the upright form of man is shut
out from their protection. Do this, and the Unity of
the Republic will be fixed on a foundation that cannot
fail. The corner-stone of National Independence is already
in its place, and on it is inscribed the name of
<span class="smcap">George Washington</span>. Another stone must also have
place at the corner. It is the great Declaration itself,
once a promise, at last a reality. On this adamantine
block we will gratefully inscribe the name of <span class="smcap">Abraham
Lincoln</span>.</p>

<p class="dropcap">GENTLEMEN,&mdash;Your petition asking for the right
to vote has been forwarded to me here, with the
request that I would present it to the President. I
regret much that my absence from Washington has
prevented me from doing this in person; but I have
lost no time in forwarding the petition to the President,
with my most earnest recommendation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>You need not beg me to use influence in your behalf.
I cannot help doing so to the extent of my ability.</p>

<p>Allow me to add, that you must not be impatient.
You have borne the heavier burdens of Slavery; and as
these are now removed, believe the others surely will
be also. This enfranchised Republic, setting an example
to mankind, cannot continue to sanction an odious
Oligarchy, whose single distinctive element is color. I
have no doubt that you will be admitted to the privileges
of citizens.</p>

<p>It is impossible to suppose that Congress will sanction
governments in the Rebel States which are not
founded on “the consent of the governed.” This is the
corner-stone of republican institutions. Of course, by
the “governed” is meant all the loyal citizens, without
distinction of color. Anything else is mockery.</p>

<p>Never neglect your work; but meanwhile prepare
yourselves for the privileges of citizens. They are yours
of right, and I do not doubt that they will be yours
soon in reality. The prejudice of caste and a false interpretation
of the Constitution cannot prevail against
justice and common sense, both of which are on your
side; and I may add the Constitution also, which,
when properly interpreted, is clearly on your side.</p>

<p class="sig">Accept my best wishes, and believe me, fellow-citizens,</p>

<h2><a name="THE_LATE_GEORGE_LIVERMORE_ESQ" id="THE_LATE_GEORGE_LIVERMORE_ESQ"></a>THE LATE GEORGE LIVERMORE, ESQ.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Article in the Boston Daily Advertiser, September 2, 1865.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">In the death of Mr. Livermore we have all lost a
friend. He was naturally and essentially kind.
He was also most conscientious and sincere. He was
exquisite in simplicity. He was pure in heart. Though
retiring and modest, he was outspoken and courageous
for the Right. His instinctive earnestness was always
on the side of virtue. These qualities marked him in
all the walks of life. To these must be added a general
intelligence, much acquired information, business
talents of no common order, and an immense love of
books.</p>

<p>He was a merchant always, and his name will hereafter
be inscribed proudly among those who have done
honor to the commercial life of Boston. Men are remembered
most by what they do outside their profession.
Although not unsuccessful in business, Mr.
Livermore will be commemorated as a merchant who
excelled in refined tastes, in generous sympathies, and
in literary studies. He was an example of what a merchant
may be, not only at his counting-house, but at
home, in association with men, in the Sunday school,
in counsel to the young, and especially in his library.</p>

<p>Among his schoolmates was one whose reputation
in the medical profession is enhanced by acknowledged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
fame as writer and as poet, who cheered him during
his late illness.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> I had not the advantage of acquaintance
with Mr. Livermore at that early day. I knew
him first as he was about to visit Europe, and I cannot
forget his absorbing interest at that time in the family
of William Roscoe. He admired the accomplished
author of the history of Lorenzo de’ Medici and of
Leo the Tenth, because he was a merchant who cultivated
letters, and while in England one of his peculiar
pleasures was to study on the spot the life and character
of this merchant author. His interest in bibliography
was recognized by Dibdin, the great professor
of the science, who conceived a friendship for his
American disciple.</p>

<p>On his return, our merchant, while engaged in all
the activities of business, renewed his devotion to those
other pursuits which made him so dear to a large and
growing circle. His library increased. His specialty
was Bibles, of which he formed a precious collection.
Among these is one which once belonged to Melancthon,
with notes in the autograph of this mild and
scholarly Reformer. There is also a very rare copy of
“The Soldier’s Pocket Bible,” in antique print and
spelling, as published for the God-fearing Ironsides of
Oliver Cromwell. In other departments the library is
rich and interesting. Mr. Livermore read his books,
but he had a true pleasure in looking at them. He
was choice in editions, and careful in bindings. Anything
in vellum or large paper had a fascination for
him, showing that he had not conversed with Dibdin
in vain. This library, after overflowing the rooms of
his house, was gathered into a beautiful apartment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
built expressly for it. There, at the close of the day,
after the cares of business were over, he found a pleasant
retreat, interrupted only by the welcome visit of
friends. His moderate desires were amply gratified,
and he was happy. The library of Prospero was not
more to him, when he “prized it above his dukedom.”</p>

<p>As a member of learned societies and of charitable
associations, Mr. Livermore was indefatigable. Perhaps
nobody in our community was more felt in these quiet
and unobtrusive labors. His interest in public affairs
was constant also, and this became intense as the great
issue presented by the Rebellion loomed into sight.
He busied himself to raise troops. More important
still, at a critical moment, before the Government had
determined to enlist colored soldiers, he prepared and
printed at his own expense a most instructive elucidation
of this question, founded on our Revolutionary
history, which he entitled “An Historical Research respecting
the Opinions of the Founders of the Republic
on Negroes, as Slaves, as Citizens, and as Soldiers.”
This was read to the Massachusetts Historical Society,
14th August, 1862, two months before the first Proclamation
of Emancipation, and nine months before the
famous Fifty-fourth Regiment, of Massachusetts, commanded
by Colonel Shaw, sailed from Boston. Among
the agencies which swayed the public mind at that
time, this work is conspicuous, and it is within my
own knowledge that it much interested President Lincoln.
While preparing the final Proclamation of Emancipation,
the President expressed a desire to consult
it, and, as his own copy was mislaid, he requested me
to send him mine, which I did. But while performing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
this patriotic service, our merchant did not forget his
bibliographical tastes. The many editions were all remarkable
for faultless paper and type, and one of them,
now before me, is on large paper.</p>

<p>At the time of his death Mr. Livermore was fifty-six
years of age, which was also the age of President Lincoln,
for whom he entertained unbounded regard, deepening
into affectionate reverence. By the bedside, in his last
illness, hung a copy of the immortal Proclamation,
signed by its author in his own autograph. There also
within reach were good books, which he enjoyed as long
as he could enjoy anything, and even after he began to
lose hold of life.</p>

<p>The death of such a man must make many sad. To
family, friends, and neighbors it will be irreparable. To
the whole community it is a calamity. There is more
than one mourner who will repeat, from the bottom of
his heart, the words of the great poet:&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Hon. Tappan Wentworth, of Lowell, and Hon. William Brigham,
of Boston, were appointed to conduct Mr. Sumner to the chair.
Enthusiastic applause greeted his appearance on the platform. He
then made the speech which follows.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The report of the Boston <i>Daily Advertiser</i> says: “Mr. Sumner’s
Address, which we give on our second page, was heard with the most
profound attention, and was at many points greeted with the most enthusiastic
expressions of approval. The argument for the exclusion of
Rebels from political power was especially applauded, and there could
be no doubt of the sentiments of the Republican party of Massachusetts
on this question. When Mr. Sumner concluded, the manifestations
of applause were vehemently renewed.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After the speech, Hon. Amasa Walker offered resolutions in tribute
to Richard Cobden, recently deceased, in whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span> “our country has lost
one of its most earnest and devoted friends, and England one of her
ablest statesmen,” and tendering to his family sincere and heartfelt
sympathy in their bereavement, which were adopted unanimously, and
afterwards communicated by Mr. Sumner to Mrs. Cobden.</p>

<p>A letter was read from Governor Andrew, declaring his purpose to
retire from office at the close of the present year, when Hon. Alexander
H. Bullock, of Worcester, was unanimously nominated as the
candidate for Governor. Hon. William Claflin, of Newton, was unanimously
nominated as candidate for Lieutenant-Governor.</p>

<p>On the adjournment for dinner Mr. Sumner left for Boston, and in
the afternoon the chair was taken by Gen. Butler, who addressed the
Convention, declaring himself in favor of Equality of Rights and justice
for all. “We hope,” said he, “that hereafter the great Massachusetts
idea&mdash;that every man has a right to be the equal of every
other man&mdash;shall become a vital essence of government upon this continent
forever.” [<i>Applause.</i>]</p>

<p>Mr. Bullock, the nominee for Governor, followed in a brief address,
in which he said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;You cannot wish that I should enter upon the discussion
of national topics, overwhelming as they are, at this hour. The
distinguished Senator, who has so long and so well represented the people
of the State,&mdash;how long and how well you all know [<i>applause</i>],&mdash;and the
other gentleman who has preceded me this afternoon, and who has served
with equal ability in the civil and military departments of the Government
[<i>applause</i>], have rendered any words of mine superfluous. Only let me say
that I choose to abide by the Massachusetts doctrines, and that I trust that
some familiarity has taught me what they are.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. William Claflin, the nominee for Lieutenant-Governor, spoke
in the same strain.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Resolutions, which were unanimously adopted, declared,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And we call upon Congress, before whom must speedily come the whole
question of reorganizing the Southern communities, to see to it that the
loyal people, white and black, shall have the most perfect guaranties for
safety, before any final steps are taken toward the readmission of the revolted
people of the South to their forfeited rights.”</p>

</div>

<p>The Convention adjourned after a day of utmost harmony.</p>

<h3>SPEECH.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">FELLOW-CITIZENS,&mdash;Called to preside over this
Annual Convention, where are brought together
the intelligence, the heart, and the conscience of Massachusetts,
(God bless her!) I begin by asking you to
accept my thanks. Gladly would I leave this post of
honor to another; but I obey your will. In all I have
to say I must speak frankly. What has with me become
a habit is at this moment more than ever a duty.
Who can see peril to his country, and not cry out?
Who can see that good ship which carries the Republic
and its fortunes driving directly upon a lee-shore,
and not shout to the pilot, “Mind your helm”? Apologies
or roundabout phrases are out of place, whenever
danger threatens.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When last I addressed my fellow-citizens, at the
close of the late Presidential canvass, as we were about
to vote for Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson, I
undertook to show the absolute identity between Slavery
and the Rebellion, so that one could not end without
the other. Finished that address, I said to friends
near me, “This is my last Antislavery speech.” I so
thought at the time; for I anticipated the speedy downfall
of the Rebellion, carrying with it Slavery. I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
mistaken. Neither the Rebellion nor Slavery is yet
ended. The Rebellion has been disarmed; but that is
all. Slavery has been abolished in name; but that is
all. As there is still a <i>quasi</i> Rebellion, so is there still
a <i>quasi</i> Slavery. The work of liberation is not yet completed.
Nor can it be, until the Equal Rights of every
person once claimed as a slave are placed under the
safeguard of irreversible guaranties. It is not enough
to prostrate the master; you must also lift up the
slave. It is not enough to declare Emancipation; the
whole Black Code, which is the supplement of Slavery,
must give place to that Equality before the Law which
is the very essence of Liberty. It is an old principle
of the Common Law, recognized by all our courts, as
announced by Lord Coke, that, “where the law granteth
anything to any one, that also is granted without
which the thing itself cannot be.” So, also, where a
piece of land is conveyed which is enclosed by the
possessions of the grantor, <i>a right of way</i> is implied
from common justice and the necessity of the case.
And then again, where the reason of a law ceases, the
law itself ceases. So, also, where the principal falls to
the ground, the incident falls also. But all these unquestionable
principles are fatal to the Black Code.
The Liberty that has been granted “cannot be,” if the
Black Code exists. The piece of land conveyed is useless
without that right of way which is stopped up
by the Black Code. The reason for the Black Code
is Slavery; and with the cessation of the reason, the
whole Black Code itself must cease also. The Black
Code is the incident of Slavery, and as such it must
fall with the principal. Unless this is accomplished, you
will keep the word of promise to the ear and break it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
to the sense; you will imitate those cruel quibbles, of
which history makes mention, where, by subtle equivocations,
faith has been violated; you will do little
better than the Turk, who stipulated with a certain
person that his head should be safe, and straightway
proceeded to cut him in two at the middle,&mdash;or than
those false Greeks, who, after promising to restore their
captives, kept their promise by restoring them dead.</p>

<p>Slavery begins by denying the right of a man to
himself; and the Black Code continues this denial by
its cruel exclusions. Every freedman must be secured
in this right by admission to the full panoply of citizenship.</p>

<p>Slavery sets at nought the relation of husband and
wife. Every freedman must be able to claim his wife
as his own.</p>

<p>Slavery sets at nought the parental relation. Every
freedman must be able to call his child his own.</p>

<p>Slavery shuts the gates of knowledge. Every freedman
must be assured in all the privileges of education.</p>

<p>Slavery takes from its victim the hard-earned fruits
of his toil. Every freedman must be protected in his
industry.</p>

<p>Slavery denies justice to the colored man by cruelly
rejecting his testimony. Every freedman must enter
the courts freely, as witness or as party.</p>

<p>Until all this is done, in every particular, and beyond
possibility of question, it is vain to say that Emancipation
has been accomplished. The good work is only
half done. It must be continued to assured consummation,
under the powerful auspices of the Nation. The
same national authority which began it must take care
that it is maintained and completed, in letter and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
spirit, everywhere throughout the Rebel States,&mdash;in
conventions of the people, in legislative assemblies, in
courts, in the city, in the country, in streets, on highways,
on by-ways, in retired places, on plantations, in
houses,&mdash;so that no man shall be despoiled of any of
his rights, but all shall be equal before the law.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is a glorious instance in our own day, which
is an example for us, when the Emperor of Russia, by
proclamation, fulfilling the aspirations of his predecessors,
set free twenty-three millions of serfs, and then
completed his work by <i>supplementary provisions</i> investing
the freedmen with civil and political rights, including
the right to testify in court, the right of suffrage,
and the right to hold office. I have in my hand
this immortal Proclamation, dated at St. Petersburg,
19th February, 1861,&mdash;promulgated amidst prayers and
thanksgivings in all the churches of the national capital,
and at once expedited to every part of the widely extended
empire by the hands of generals and staff-officers
of the Emperor himself. Here it is, in an official document
entitled “Affranchissement des Serfs,” and issued
at St. Petersburg. After reciting that earlier measures
in behalf of the serfs had failed, because they had been
left to “the spontaneous initiative of the proprietors,”
the Emperor proceeds to take the work in hand
as a sacred legacy from his ancestors, and declares
the serfs, after an interval of two years, “entirely enfranchised.”
Meanwhile, that nothing might fail, “a
special court” for serfs was created in each province,
charged with the organization of local governments, the
adjustment of boundaries, and generally to superintend
the transition from the Old to the New, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span> “justices
of the peace” in each district to examine on the spot
all questions arising from Emancipation. Had the work
stopped here, it would have been incomplete, it would
have been only half done; but no such fatal mistake
was made.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>Accompanying the Proclamation are supplementary
provisions, called “Regulations,” prepared with care,
and divided into chapters and sections,&mdash;occupying
no less than ninety-one pages in double columns and
small type,&mdash;by which the rights of the freedmen are
secured beyond question. Beginning with the declaration
that the freedmen “acquire the rights belonging
to the condition of free farmers,” they then proceed in
formal words to fix and assure these rights, civil and
political. By one section it is provided that “the articles
of the Civil Code on the rights and obligations of
the family are extended to the freedmen; that consequently
they acquire the right, without authorization
of the proprietor, to contract marriage, and to make
any arrangement whatever concerning their family affairs;
that they can equally enter into all agreements
and obligations authorized by the laws, as well with the
State as with individuals, on the conditions established
for free farmers; that they can inscribe themselves in
the guilds, and exercise their trades in the villages;
and they can found and conduct factories and establishments
of commerce.” Another section secures to the
freedmen the right of acquiring and alienating property
of all kinds, according to the general law, and, besides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
guaranties, on certain conditions, “the possession of
their homesteads,” with the grounds appurtenant. An
additional section secures them complete <i>Equality in
the courts</i>, with “the right of action, whether civilly or
criminally, to commence process, and to answer personally
or by attorney, to make complaint, and to defend
their rights by all the means known to the law,
<i>and to appear as witnesses and as bail, conformably to
the common law</i>.” Other sections secure to the freedmen
<i>Equality in political rights</i>, by providing, that, “on
the organization of the towns, they shall be entitled to
take part in the meetings and elections for the towns,
and to vote on town affairs, and to exercise divers functions”;
that they shall also “take part in the assemblies
for the district, and shall vote on district affairs,
and choose the chairman,” and generally enjoy all rights
to elect local officers and to be elected in turn. And
still another section authorizes the freedmen “to place
their children in the establishments for public education,
to embrace the career of instruction, or the scientific
career, or to take service in the corps of surveyors.”
And it is further provided, that they “cannot lose their
rights, or be restrained in their exercise, except after
judgment of the town, according to fixed rules”; and
still further, that they “cannot be subjected to any punishment,
otherwise than by virtue of a judgment, or
according to the legal decision of the town to which
they belong.” Such are the safeguards by which Emancipation
in Russia is completed and assured. Such is
the lesson of the great Empire to the great Republic.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In asking that we shall do likewise, I follow the
plain suggestions of reason, whether we regard the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
interest of the freedmen or our own. For justice to
the freedmen is now intimately linked with the national
security. Be just, and the Republic will be strong. Be
just, and you will erect a barrier against returning Rebellion.
Here Massachusetts has a duty to perform.
Now, as in times past, her place is in the front. You
will not, I trust, be disturbed by criticism, even if it
become invective. Throughout the long conflict with
Slavery, and the earlier conflict with the mother country,
Massachusetts has been accustomed to hard words;
and even at a more ancient day, as far back in colonial
history as 1691, we find an ill-tempered critic, with a
strange jumble of metaphors, crying out against our fathers:
“All the frame of heaven moves upon one axis;
and the whole of New England interests seem designed
to be loaden on one bottom, and her particular motions
to be concentric to the Massachusetts tropic. You
know who are wont to trot after the Bay horse.”<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> If
others trot after the Bay horse, it is simply because
Massachusetts means always to keep on the right road,
and by unerring instinct knows the way. Error proceeds
oftener from ignorance than from malice. Obviously,
at this moment, the great difficulty is that people
do not see clearly what ought to be done.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Fellow-citizens, as peace seems about to smile on our
country, convulsed by most cruel and costly war, there
is one simple duty on which all can unite, when it is
understood. It is the duty expressed in at least one
part of the familiar saying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span> “Indemnity for the past
and <i>security for the future</i>.” Indemnity, alas! we can
never have. Who can repay the millions of lost
treasure? Who can repair the shattered and mutilated
forms returned from the terrible battle with Slavery?
Who can recall the dead? Indemnity we renounce.
There are no scales on earth in which it can
be weighed. There are no possible accumulations of
wealth that would not be exhausted before its first
instalment was counted out. But no such difficulty
can occur in adjusting security for the future. And
the very vastness of our sacrifice is an irresistible reason
why this should be fixed beyond question, so that
the appalling judgment shall not visit us again. Indemnity
we renounce; <i>but security we will have</i>. This
is the one thing needful. This is the charity embracing
all other charities. This is the pivot of the
national Hereafter. This is at once corner-stone and
key-stone of that reconstructed Union to which we look
for tranquil peace and reconciliation. There are none
so high, and there are none so low, as not to be concerned
in obtaining this security; for without it all that
we hold most dear will be in jeopardy. Without security,
agriculture and commerce must languish and die;
without security, the whole country must be impoverished
in resources, while the rich become poor and
the poor become poorer; without security, rights of
property and rights of person will lose their value; and
without security, the Union, justice, domestic tranquillity,
the common defence, the general welfare, and the
blessings of Liberty, for which the Constitution was
ordained and established, must all fail. What is government,
or country, or home, or life itself, without
security?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>

<p>There is another object, kindred to security, or, perhaps,
embraced in security,&mdash;and that is the <i>national
faith</i>. This, too, must be placed beyond cavil, or even
suspicion. No nation can be powerful enough to disregard
this sacred bond. Character, fame, and prosperity
itself are all dependent on its observance. But the
national faith is solemnly engaged, first, to the national
freedman, and, secondly, to the national creditor. No
undertaking can be more complete and inviolable, because
it constituted the consideration for those services
and supplies by which the life of the Republic has been
preserved. The national faith is pledged to the national
freedman, not only by the act of Emancipation, which,
in its very essence, and from the nature of the case, is
a “warranty of title,” but also by the plain and positive
promises of the Proclamation, that they “<i>are and
henceforward shall be free</i>, and that the Executive Government
of the United States, including the military
and naval authorities thereof, will recognize and <i>maintain
the freedom of said persons</i>.” Words could not be
more binding, and the history of their introduction testifies
to their significance and efficacy. They were not
in the original draught by President Lincoln, but were
inserted, at the suggestion of Mr. Seward, when the
Proclamation was read to the Cabinet; and there they
stand without limitation of place or time, binding this
Republic in its national character, through its Executive,
including the military and naval authority, not
only to recognize, but to <i>maintain</i>, the freedom of the
emancipated slave; and this is to be done, not in any
special locality, but everywhere,&mdash;and not for a day or
a year, but for all time. Our obligation to the national
creditors is of the same validity, approved by successive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
Acts of Congress, ratified by the popular will, and fixed
beyond recall by the actual enjoyment of those precious
fruits for which the debt was incurred. Repudiation of
our bonds, whether to the national creditor or to the
national freedman, would be a shame and a crime; and
the national faith is irrevocably plighted to the two
alike. Here is the Proclamation, and here is a Treasury
Note. [<i>Here Mr. Sumner held up an official copy of the
Proclamation, and also a Treasury Note.</i>] Look at
the signature, and look at the terms. The former is
signed by the President himself, Abraham Lincoln; the
latter is signed by an unknown clerk, whose name I
cannot decipher. The former is stronger and more
positive in terms than the latter. The Treasury Note
simply says: “It is hereby certified that the United
States are indebted unto ____ or bearer in the sum of
$100, redeemable” after a certain date, and that “this
debt is authorized by Act of Congress.” The binding
terms of the Proclamation, which I have read, are solemnly
enforced by that memorable invocation at the
close: “And upon this act, sincerely believed to be
an act of justice warranted by the Constitution upon
military necessity, I invoke the considerate judgment
of mankind and the gracious favor of Almighty God.”
Thus religion comes to confirm the pledge with sanctions
of its own. That pledge is as enduring as the
Republic.</p>

<p>Such are the supreme objects now at heart: the
National Security and the National Faith, or the two
absorbed into one,&mdash;<i>Security for the Future</i>.</p>

<p>And here allow me to present an illustration, which,
unless I mistake, will make our duty clear. You all
remember the immense and costly dikes built by Holland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
against the sea; but perhaps you may not recall
their origin and importance. Before these embankments
the whole country was in constant danger. At
an early period an irruption swallowed up no less than
forty-four villages, followed very soon by another, which
destroyed eighty thousand lives. In the fifteenth century
still another swept away one hundred thousand
persons,&mdash;a terrible sacrifice, even greater in proportion
to the population of Holland at that time than we have
been called to bear from the bloody irruption of Slavery.
At last dikes were constructed as safeguards, and down
to this day they are preserved at large annual cost.
Precautions of all kinds are superadded. A special corps
of engineers, educated at Delft, is constantly employed
in the work of renovation. Watchmen patrol the walls,
and alarm-bells are ready to ring. The gratitude of the
people is manifest even to unconscious protectors; and
the stork, resting here on his flight from Africa, is held
in veneration for his precious service in destroying the
vermin that weaken and sap the dikes; so that to kill
a stork is little less than crime. Such are defences by
which Holland is guarded against dangers from the sea.
But how petty is her peril, compared with ours! We,
too, must have our dikes, with engineers to keep them
strong, with watchmen to patrol, with alarm-bells to
ring; and we, too, must have our storks to destroy the
vermin that weaken and sap our embankments.</p>

<p>What shall be our defences? How shall we guard
against destructive irruptions? And where shall we
establish our security for the future? Our embankments
cannot be of earth. Walls of stone will not
do. Towers, ramparts, and buttresses are impotent
against our vindictive tide. The security we seek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
must be found in <i>irreversible guaranties, coëxtensive with
the danger</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It becomes us, then, to consider carefully the elements
of danger,&mdash;bearing in mind always that a danger
clearly foreseen will not happen, unless prudence
has ceased to prevail. These may be considered in general
and in detail. They may be considered in certain
general influences, applicable to all our relations with
the Rebellion, or in certain specific points, obviously
requiring specific guaranties.</p>

<p>If we look at the Rebel States generally, there is
little to inspire trust. They rose against a paternal
government simply for the sake of Slavery, planting
themselves upon two postulates furnished by John C.
Calhoun,&mdash;first, State Rights, and, secondly, the alleged
falsehood of our fathers, when, at the birth of our nation,
they declared that all men are born equal. Since
that early war when Satan “in proud rebellious arms
drew after him the third part of heaven’s sons,” nothing
so utterly wicked has occurred. And the spirit of
Satan entered into the Rebellion, and continued with
it to the end. It was present on the battle-field; it
was present in the treatment of Union prisoners; it was
present in the piracies of the ocean. I know not that
these devils have yet been cast out. I know not that
any swine into which they entered have rushed headlong
into the sea. But I do know, that, according to
concurring and unimpeachable testimony from all quarters
of the Rebel States, from North Carolina to Texas,
there is one sullen, defiant voice, which, in the very
words of Satan, when driven from the skies, thus
speaks:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Such is their spirit. Grounding arms, they now resort
to other means. Cunning takes the place of war.
As they precipitated themselves out of the Union, they
now seek to precipitate themselves back. A “wooden
horse” is constructed, which is stuffed with hidden foes,
and thus they seek to enter Troy. Already the rattle
of arms is heard, and ominous voices, as the treacherous
engine is advanced; but, beyond these sounds,
there is the record of the past and the present. Who
does not know that the South is full of spirits who
have sworn undying hatred, not only to the Union,
but to reason itself, and whose policy is a perpetual
conspiracy against the principles of our Government?
Painful proofs come to demonstrate the prevailing frenzy.
The freedmen are trodden down, and the land
is filled with tragedies. History stands aghast at the
Massacre of Glencoe in a retired Scotch valley, and
our sympathies overflow at the murder of a solitary
traveller by the merciless Indian; but these scenes are
now repeated. The barbarism of Slavery rages still.
The lash and the bloodhound are at large. Life is of
little value, if it beats under a colored skin. Citizens
in the national uniform are insulted, mutilated, murdered,&mdash;especially
if in command of colored troops.
And these criminals, besmeared with patriot blood, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
boiling with concentrated rage, now strive to envelop
themselves in the immunities of State Independence,
with two special objects: first, that they may deal with
the freedman as they please, without check from the
national authority; and, secondly, that they may send a
solid representation of more than eighty votes, pledged
to Southern pretensions, which, in combination with
treacherous votes from the North, may reassert that
ancient monopoly and masterdom under which the
country suffered so long,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="noindent">One of their orators said plainly, that “he was opposed
to fighting the General Government, or anybody else,&mdash;<i>that
he was ready to submit to its wishes, as he would to
a highway robber whose power he was not able to resist</i>.”
Another, less frank, thought it policy to accept the present
condition of affairs, until the control of the State is
restored into the hands of its people, and “to submit
<i>for a time</i> to evils which cannot be remedied.” And
still another, much more wily, when urging seeming
acceptance of the Union, thus lured his brother conspirators:
“<i>If we act wisely, we shall be joined by what
is called the Copperhead party</i>, and even by many of the
Black Republicans.” Such is the plot, and such the
disastrous alliance foreshadowed. But, thank God, in
encouraging his comrades, the conspirator has warned
us. Forewarned, forearmed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

<p>From all quarters comes the warning, “Trust not
their presents, nor admit the horse!” The voice of the
Grecian Sinon was not more treacherous. The testimony
is concurring. Military officers returning from
the South, public functionaries, intelligent travellers,
loyal residents, each and all speak with one voice. By
conversation and by letter I have gathered the proofs,
which are complete. Persons who have had peculiar
opportunities unite in report that the rebel spirit still
prevails, that the treatment of the freedmen is beastly,
and that the national debt is denounced. Two eminent
gentlemen, whose official positions have made
them familiar with public opinion in two different
States, have expressed to me the conviction that there
is not a single ex-Rebel who would vote to pay the interest
on the national debt. A trustworthy traveller,
who has just visited Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama,
with which he was already familiar, writes me:
“The former masters exhibit a most cruel, remorseless,
and vindictive spirit towards the colored people. In
parts where there are no Union soldiers, I saw colored
women treated in the most outrageous manner. They
have no rights that are respected. They are killed, and
their bodies thrown into ponds or mud-holes. They are
mutilated by having ears and noses cut off.” A loyalist
from Texas declares: “What we of the South fear is
that President Johnson’s course will, by its <i>precipitancy</i>,
enable the old set to reorganize themselves into place
and power. For Heaven’s sake preserve us, if you can,
from this calamity.” A loyal resident of North Carolina
breaks forth:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span> “I tell you, Sir, the only difference now
and one year ago is that the flag is acknowledged as
supreme, and there is some fear manifested, and they
have no arms. The sentiment is the same. If anything
otherwise, more hatred exists towards the Government.
I know there is more towards Union men, both black
and white.” It is natural that such a people should
already talk of repudiating the national debt. Here
is a bit on this vital point. A young man in gray
was asked: “Would it be safe to trust white men at
the South with the power to repudiate the national
debt?” To which he replied at once: “Repudiate?
I should hope they would! I’m whipped, and I’ll
own it; but I’m not so fond of a whipping that I’m
going to pay a man’s expenses while he gives it to
me. Of course, there are not ten men in the whole
South that wouldn’t repudiate!” Thus spoke the
Rebel uniform. But here are the grave words of a
candidate for Congress in Virginia, in his address to
the people:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am opposed to the Southern States being taxed at all
for the redemption of this debt, either directly or indirectly;
and if elected to Congress, I will oppose all such measures,
and I will vote to repeal all laws that have heretofore been
passed for that purpose; and in doing so, I do not consider
that I violate any obligations to which the South was a
party. We have never plighted our faith for the redemption
of the war debt. The people will be borne down with
taxes for years to come, even if the war debt is repudiated.
It will be the duty of the Government to support the
maimed and disabled soldiers, and this will be a great
expense; and if the United States Government requires
the South to be taxed for the support of Union soldiers,
we should insist that all disabled soldiers should be maintained
by the United States Government, without regard
to the side they had taken in the war.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<p>Again I say, Forewarned, forearmed. Surely there
can be no limits to our resistance, when such spirits are
seeking to capture the National Government; but beyond
that general resistance, which must make us postpone
the day of surrender, and invoke the protection of
Congress, we must insist upon <i>special guaranties</i> in the
organic law.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>1. As the Rebellion began with the pretension that
a State might withdraw from the Union, it is plain that
the <i>Unity of the Republic</i> must be affirmed,&mdash;not indirectly,
but directly,&mdash;not, as in Mississippi, by simply
declaring the late Act of Secession null and void, but
as in Missouri, where the relations of the State to the
Union are thus frankly stated: “That this State shall
ever remain a member of the American Union; <i>that the
people thereof are a part of the American Nation</i>; that
every citizen owes paramount allegiance to the Constitution
and Government of the United States; and that
no law or ordinance of this State in contravention or
subversion thereof can have any binding force.” In
contrast with this plain renunciation, the proceedings of
Mississippi have no more significance than the vulgar
saying, “Big as a piece of chalk.” As security for the
future, they are nothing, absolutely nothing. And permit
me to say, that the whole Convention, so far as
we have been informed, was little better than a Rebel
conspiracy to obtain political power.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>2. As the Rebellion was waged in denial of the
<i>Equal Rights</i> of the colored race, it is essential not only
that Slavery should be renounced, but also that all men
should be hailed as equal before the law; and this enfranchisement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
must be both civil and political. Unless
this is done, the condition of the freedman will be deplorable.
Exposed to every brutality, he will not be
heard as a witness against his oppressor. Compelled to
pay taxes, he will be excluded from all representation
in the government. Without this security, Emancipation
is illusory. It is a jack-o’-lantern, which the poor
slave will pursue in vain. Even if Slavery cease to
exist, it will give place to a condition hardly less
galling. There will be serfdom, apprenticeship, peonage,
or some other device of Slavery. According to the
poet, there are different “circles” in Hell, each with its
own terrible torments; and the unhappy African will
only escape from one of these into another. And all
this will be beyond correction or remedy, if not at the
outset guarded against by organic law.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>3. As the <i>national debt</i> was incurred for the suppression
of the Rebellion, this, too, must be fixed beyond
repeal. Unless this is done, it is evident, from reason
as well as from testimony, that the representatives of
the Rebel States will coalesce with others for its repudiation.
Mississippi, which leads in the present effort
to capture the national capital, is the original author
of repudiation. Out of the legislative halls of this
State the monster sprang. There was its birth. It
will be simply true to its past history, as well as to
its present animosities, when this State leads in the
repudiation of the national debt. Nothing short of
madness will allow any such opportunity. No Rebel
State should be readmitted, unless bound irrevocably
to the support of the national debt and the payment
of the interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>4. The <i>assumption of the Rebel debt</i> must be positively
forbidden. Already ex-Rebels insist upon its
payment. Such voices come from Mississippi and Virginia.
Ex-Rebel newspapers, whose editors have taken
the oath of allegiance, uphold this debt. But Congress
has already led the way in denouncing it. For a State
to assume this criminal obligation would be oppressive
to the people, and especially to the freedmen. It would
be a drain upon the resources of the State. It would be
an insult to the whole country. This debt, whether at
home or abroad, has been incurred for the support of the
Rebellion, and must be treated accordingly. It is part
of the crime. Here, too, there must be a guaranty.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>5. As the <i>national peace and tranquillity</i> depend
essentially upon the overthrow of monopoly and tyranny,
here is another occasion for special guaranty
against the whole pretension of color. No Rebel State
can be readmitted with this controversy still raging,
and ready to break forth. So long as it continues,
the land will be barren. Agriculture and business of
all kinds will be uncertain, and the country will be
handed over to a fearful struggle, with the terrors of
San Domingo to darken the prospect. In shutting out
the freedman from his equal rights at the ballot-box,
you open the doors of discontent and insurrection.
Cavaignac, the patriotic President of the French Republic,
met the present case, when, speaking for France,
he said: “I do not believe repose possible, either in
the present or the future, except so far as you found
your political condition on universal suffrage, loyally,
sincerely, completely accepted and observed.”<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
<i>impartial suffrage</i> that I claim, without distinction of
color, so that there shall be one equal rule for all men.
And this, too, must be placed under the safeguard of
Constitutional Law.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>6. As the <i>education of the people</i> is essential to the
national welfare, and especially to the development of
those principles of justice and morality which constitute
the only sure foundation of a Republican Government,
and as, according to the census, an immense proportion
of the people of the Rebel States, without distinction
of color, cannot read and write, it is obvious that public
schools must be established for the equal good of all.
The example of Massachusetts must be followed, which,
after declaring in its Constitution that “wisdom and
knowledge, as well as virtue, diffused generally among
the body of the people, are necessary for the preservation
of their rights and liberties,” proceeds to direct
the Legislature and magistrates, in all future periods,
“to cherish the interests of literature and the sciences,”
and especially “public schools and grammar schools in
the towns.” All this must enter into our work of reconstruction,
and become one of our guaranties.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such are six capital subjects of special guaranty:
the unity of the Republic; the national obligations to
the national freedmen; the national obligations to the
national creditors; the rejection of the Rebel debt; the
establishment of national peace and tranquillity, so that
it cannot be disturbed by any monopoly and tyranny
founded on color; and, lastly, the education of the
people. All these are too important, too transcendent,
too essential to the national safety, to be left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
the prey or sport of Rebel passions; nor can they be
abandoned to any vague promise or inference of any
kind. They must be fixed in characters clear as the
sky and firm as the earth. Not to require this protection
is unpardonable weakness. “If Philip dies,”
said the Athenian orator, “you will soon raise another
Philip; since it is not so much by his own power as
by your carelessness that he grew to such greatness.”
And so do I say now, even if the Rebellion is dead, you
will soon raise another, unless you learn to be wise.
Believe me, that man is dangerous who does not see
danger in this Rebel Oligarchy, now conspiring to hoist
itself into power.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Therefore I lay down one undeniable, essential principle,&mdash;that
these guaranties must be established; and
I appeal to my fellow-citizens throughout the country
to insist upon them. As they concern the National
Security and the National Faith, it is clear that they
should be established by the Nation. The object is
national. The power to establish them is national also.
It is part of that great instinctive right of <i>self-defence</i>,
common to nations and to men, which has no limits,
except in the benign constraints of a Christian civilization.
It is a right not only from the Constitution
of the United States, but also from the constitution
of civil society itself. There is no nation without it.
In the weakest it is as manifest as in the mightiest.
Never before was the occasion for its exercise plainer.
And who shall say that the nation may defend itself
on the murderous battle-field, and may not, when the
battle has been won, require that “Security for the
Future” which is the declared object of war?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span></p>

<p>Do you ask where in the Constitution this unquestionable
power is found? I answer, in the same
clause where you find the power to raise armies, and
hurl them upon the Rebel enemy,&mdash;in the same clause
where you find the power to erect fortifications, bastions,
and bulwarks for the national defence,&mdash;in the
same clause where you find the power to incur the
national debt for the national defence,&mdash;and also in
the same clause where President Lincoln found the
power to emancipate the slave. It is a national power
for the protection of the nation, and it may be exercised
to any extent needed. It is idle to say that the
war is over, and therefore the power is suspended. In
one sense the war is over, and in another it is not.
Battles have ceased; but Security for the Future is
not yet obtained, and this security is found only in
irreversible guaranties.</p>

<p>This national power is still in full operation, and
as completely constitutional as the power to raise armies.
It assumes for the present purpose two forms:
first, the power to hold military possession of the Rebel
States, so long as required for security,&mdash;whether
months or years; and, secondly, the power to affix the
terms of peace and restoration. As it is idle to say
that the war is over, so it is equally idle to say that
this power, in either of its forms, is limited by the
Constitution. This same mistake was made by James
Buchanan, when, at the beginning of the Rebellion, he
weakly declared, that, under the Constitution, he could
not “coerce a State,” and his Cabinet assented. God
forbid that now, at another moment not less critical,
the same pretension should triumph again. Of course
all patriots see now how the golden opportunity was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
lost at first. May no such golden opportunity be lost
again! Nobody doubts now that a State in rebellion
may be “coerced.” Nobody doubts now that the victories
of Grant, the march of Sherman, and the charge of
Sheridan were strictly constitutional. But this “coercion”
must endure just so long as may be needed to
obtain Security for the Future,&mdash;it may be for months,
or it may be for years. There is no argument for it at
the beginning which is not equally strong for it now.
There is nothing in the Constitution against it. Everything
in the Constitution is for it. The rules or limitations
which the Constitution may establish for a condition
of peace are entirely inapplicable to a condition of
rebellion in any of its stages, whether at beginning, middle,
or end. Whatever is needed for the suppression
of the Rebellion and the establishment of safeguards
against its recurrence is constitutional. It is failure to
exercise this power that is unconstitutional.</p>

<p>But beyond this ample, are two other powers in the
Constitution, under which all needful guaranties can be
secured. The first is that vast untried power springing
from the injunction that “the United States shall
guaranty to every State in this Union a republican
form of government.” This power, long dormant, sprang
into activity with the Acts of Secession. Loyal government
being overthrown <i>in fact</i>, so that the whole region
was like “a clean slate,” it became the duty of
the national authority to set up loyal governments, and
at the same time to see that they were republican in
form,&mdash;which must mean at least that they are governments
of the majority, and not of the minority; and
I think I cannot err, if I add, that, according to fundamental
principles of the Declaration of Independence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
they must be founded on the equal rights of all men
and “the consent of the governed.” It is very clear
that in this clause of guaranty there is an inexhaustible
power, by virtue of which the national authority can
not only exact all needful guaranties, but can mould
these rebel communities according to the model of a
Christian Commonwealth.</p>

<p>There is still another source of power under the
Constitution; and this is according to the analogies of
the Territories. Since all loyal government has ceased
to exist, the whole region, in all its divisions and subdivisions,
has, <i>from the necessity of the case</i>, lapsed under
the national jurisdiction, which is as complete for all
practical purposes as that same jurisdiction over the
District of Columbia.</p>

<p>I do not stop to dwell on these sources of power.
Elsewhere I have vindicated them; and I have never
been answered, except by the phrase that a State cannot
go out of the Union: as if, in presence of <i>the fact
of rebellion</i>, this was anything more than a phrase. It
is indisputable, that, <i>in fact</i>, the Rebel States have
ceased to be, as President Lincoln expressed it, in
“proper practical relation with the Union,” and, still
further, that they have long been without any government
we can recognize. Surely this is enough to open
the door for the national authority. When loyal government
ceased, the jurisdiction of the National Government
began, whether military or civil; and this jurisdiction
still continues, complete in all respects, without
hindrance or limitation from the Constitution.</p>

<p>Thus, out of three inexhaustible fountains may the
National Government derive its authority: first, from
the war powers, which do not expire except with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
establishment of Security for the Future; secondly,
from the injunction to guaranty a republican form of
government, which is at once a power and a duty; and,
thirdly, from the necessity of the case, as with outlying
Territories, which have no other government. Under
each and all of these the guaranties can be obtained.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In obtaining the needed guaranties there are certain
practical points which cannot be disregarded. Knowing
what we need, and satisfied concerning the powers
of the National Government, the path is easy. As
there are ways to obtain guaranties, so also there are
ways not to obtain them.</p>

<p>And, first, of ways not to obtain them.</p>

<p>1. Irreversible guaranties cannot be obtained by <i>haste</i>.
No State must be precipitated back into the Union.
Precipitation back will be hardly less fatal than that
original precipitation which plunged the country into
the abyss of war. When a State is readmitted, it becomes
practically independent. Therefore prudence, care,
and watchfulness are needed to see that the national
interests are not imperilled by any sudden transformation.</p>

<p>2. Irreversible guaranties cannot be obtained merely
by <i>Executive action</i>. Something more is needed. No
President can truly say, “The State&mdash;it is I.” He is
only part of the State; and on this account there is a
new motive to reserve. What he does is subject to the
correction of Congress, and therefore cannot be final.
But it is difficult to see under what authority the President
can appoint officers not known to the Constitution
or laws, as is the case with Provisional Governors.
The Act of Congress authorizing their appointment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
failed to become a law; so that no such office is “established
by law,” according to the requirement of the
Constitution.</p>

<p>3. Irreversible guaranties cannot be obtained by
<i>yielding to the prejudice of color</i>, and <i>insisting upon
a separation of the races</i>. A voice from the West&mdash;God
save the West!&mdash;revives the exploded theory of
Colonization, perhaps to divert attention from the great
question of Equal Rights. To that voice I reply, first,
You ought not to do it, and, secondly, You cannot do
it. You ought not to do it, because, besides its intrinsic
and fatal injustice, you will deprive the country of
what it most needs, which is labor. Those freedmen
on the spot are better even than mineral wealth. Each
is a mine, out of whom riches can be drawn, provided
you let him share the product. And through him that
general industry will be established which is better
than anything but virtue, and is, indeed, a form of
virtue. It is vain to say that this is the country of
the “white man.” It is the country of Man. Whoever
disowns any member of the Human Family as
Brother disowns God as Father, and thus becomes impious
as well as inhuman. It is the glory of republican
institutions that they give practical form to this
irresistible principle. If anybody is to be sent away,
let it be the guilty, and not the innocent. Expatriation
of leading Rebels will be a public good. As long
as they continue here, they will resist the establishment
of guaranties; but it is little short of madness
to think of exiling loyal persons, whose strong arms
are needed, not only for the cultivation of the soil,
but also for protection of the Government itself.</p>

<p>4. Irreversible guaranties cannot be obtained by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
<i>oaths</i>. All oaths are uncertain. It has been said, “The
strongest oaths are straw.” Political oaths have become
a proverb, whether in England or France. They
have been taken freely, and have been broken without
hesitation. The Milanese, in reply to the Emperor
Barbarossa, said, “You had our oath, but we never
swore to keep it.” Our Rebels are openly taught the
same duplicity. They have been told authoritatively,
that the oath was unconstitutional, and therefore not
binding; and so they take it easily. But who can
find a guaranty in such a performance? A Swedish
priest lately poisoned the sacramental wine; and so
these counsellors have poisoned this sacred obligation.
But if an oath be taken, it must not stop with support
of the Proclamation of Emancipation. It must
embrace all those other objects of guaranty, including
especially the national freedman and the national
creditor. Each of these will be a test of loyalty.
But at a moment like the present, at the close of a
ferocious rebellion, when hatred and passion are only
pent up and not extinguished, an oath is little better
than a cotton thread to hold a frigate scourged
by a northwester. The Hollanders might as well undertake
to swear each individual wave that beats upon
their coast. They did better. They made dikes.
“Gone to swear a peace,” says Constance, most scornfully,
as she denounced an oath of pretended reconciliation.
And shall we be content when our Rebels
merely “swear a peace”?</p>

<p>5. Irreversible guaranties cannot be obtained by <i>pardons</i>.
It is enough to state the proposition; for all
must see at once that rights will be very uncertain, if
with no protection except the gratitude of a pardoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
Rebel. A jail-delivery is not a guaranty. Such a
breakwater would be impotent against the malignant
sea. Without accepting absolutely the dogma of Cardinal
Mazarin, that human beings are governed more
through hope than gratitude, it is clear, that, until security
is won, we cannot afford to part with any influence
or agency through which control may be established.
Mercy is a beautiful prerogative, exercised always
with inexpressible delight; but on this account
we must guard against its fascination, and not, in the
generous luxury, imperil a whole community. This is
very clear. A pardon is in form an act of grace, but
in reality a letter of license. This is all. It leaves the
criminal free to renew his crime, whether by force or
guile. It has in it no single point of security. As
well defend a citadel by kisses or by flowers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such are some of the modes to be rejected. And
now, in the second place, consider the ways in which
guaranties may be obtained.</p>

<p>1. <i>Time is necessary.</i> There must be no precipitation.
Time is the gentlest, but most powerful revolutionist.
Time is the surest reformer. Time is peacemaker.
Time is necessary to growth, and it is an
element of change. For thirty years and more this
wickedness was maturing. Who can say that the same
time will not be needed to mature the conditions of
permanent peace? Who can say that a generation
must not elapse before these Rebel communities have
been so far changed as to become safe associates in a
common government? Plainly, this cannot be wrought
at once. Wellington exclaimed at Waterloo, “Would
that night or Blücher were come!” Time alone was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
substitute for a powerful ally. It was more through
time than battle that La Vendée was changed to loyalty.
Time, therefore, we must have. Through time
all other guaranties may be obtained; but time itself
is a guaranty.</p>

<p>2. <i>Meanwhile follow Congress in the present exclusion
of Rebels from political power.</i> They must not
be voted for, and they must not vote. On this principle
I take my stand. Let them buy and sell; let
them till the ground; and may they be industrious and
successful. These things they may do; but they must
not be admitted at once into the copartnership of our
Government. As well might the respectable banker
reïnstate his son at once in the firm he has betrayed,
and invest him again with all the powers of a partner.
The father received his son with parental affection, and
forgave him; but he did not invite the criminal to
resume his former desk in Wall Street. And yet
the son, who had robbed and forged on an unprecedented
scale, is as worthy of trust in the old banking-house
as one of our Rebels in the government of the
country. A long probation will be needed before either
can be admitted to former fellowship. The state of
outlawry is the present condition of each, and this
condition must not be hastily relaxed.</p>

<p>Congress has already set the example by excluding
from “any office of honor or profit under the Government
of the United States,” and also by excluding, as
attorney or counsellor, from any court of the United
States, every person who has voluntarily given “aid,
countenance, counsel, or encouragement” to the Rebellion,
or who has “sought or accepted any office
whatever” under it, or who has yielded to it any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
“voluntary support.” By this and the supplementary
Act,<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> all Rebels are debarred from holding office under
the United States, or from practising in the courts of
the United States. This exclusion, thus sanctioned by
Congress, must be the pole-star of our national policy.
If Rebels cannot be officers under our Government,
they ought not to be voters. They should be politically
disfranchised, purely and simply as a measure of
necessary precaution, and in order to prepare the way
for those guaranties which we seek. “Vipers cannot
use their venom in the cold.” These are words of
political wisdom, as of scientific truth; and a great
Italian writer did not hesitate to inculcate from them
the same lesson that I do now.</p>

<p>3. Surely, recent Rebels, who led in secession, and
held office under the Rebellion, are poor professors to
rally these communities to the support of the national
freedman and the national creditor, and generally to
the establishment of the guaranties essential to safety.
Reason and experience warn us to postpone trust in
such persons. Overcome in battle, they wrap themselves
in a mantle of loyalty, tied by an oath, as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent4">“they who, to be sure of Paradise,</div>
<div class="verse">Dying, put on the weeds of Dominic,</div>
<div class="verse">Or in Franciscan think to pass disguised.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But character is not changed in a day; and that “Southern
heart,” which was “fired” against the Union, still
preserves its vindictive violence. Even if for a moment
controlled, who can tell how long it will continue in
this mood? There is an ancient well-known fable,
where a cat was transformed into a beautiful woman;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
but, on the night of her marriage, hearing the sound
of a mouse, she sprang from bed with all her original
feline nature. And so a Rebel, transformed by political
necromancy into a loyalist, will suddenly start in
full cry to run down a national freedman or national
creditor. So strong is nature. Horace tells us, “Drive
it out with a pitchfork, and it will return.” Therefore
do I insist, put not political trust in the man who has
been engaged in warring upon his country. I ask not
his punishment. I would not be harsh. There is
nothing humane that I would reject. Nothing in hate.
Nothing in vengeance. Nothing in passion. I am for
gentleness. I am for a velvet glove; but for a while
I wish the hand of iron. I confess that I have little
sympathy with those hypocrites of magnanimity whose
appeal for the Rebel master is only a barbarous indifference
towards the slave; and yet they cannot more
than I desire the day of reconciliation. To this end
I am with them, <i>so far as is consistent with safety</i>; but
I cannot see my country sacrificed to a false idea. Pardon,
if you will. Nobody shall outdo me in clemency.
But do not trust the Rebel politically. The words of
Shakespeare are not too strong to picture the danger of
such attempt:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent4">“Thou may’st hold a serpent by the tongue,</div>
<div class="verse">A chafèd lion by the mortal paw,</div>
<div class="verse">A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,</div>
<div class="verse">Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>4. In obtaining guaranties we must rely upon acts
rather than professions, and light our footsteps by “the
lamp of experience.” Therefore we turn from recent
rebels to <i>constant loyalists</i>. This is only ordinary prudence.
As those who fought against us should be for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
the present disfranchised, so those who fought for us
should be at once enfranchised, and thus a renovated
state will be built secure on an unfaltering and natural
loyalty. For a while the freedman will take the place
of the master, verifying the saying that the last shall be
first and the first shall be last. In the pious books of
the East it is declared that the greatest mortification at
the Day of Judgment will be when the faithful slave is
carried to Paradise and the wicked master is sent to
Hell; and this same reversal of conditions appears in
the Gospel, where Dives is exhibited as suffering the
pains of damnation while the beggar of other days is
sheltered in Abraham’s bosom. Therefore, in organizing
this change, we follow divine justice. Surely nobody can
doubt that Robert Small, the heroic slave who carried
a Rebel steamer to our fleet and then became our pilot,
deserves more of the Republic than a South Carolina
official occupied at that very time as commissioner to
regulate impressments in the Rebel army. To accept
the latter and to reject the former will be not only the
height of injustice, but the height of meanness. It will
be a deed “to make heaven weep, all earth amazed.”</p>

<p>5. Still further, in obtaining guaranties we must
<i>look confidently to Congress</i>, which has plenary powers
over the whole subject. Congress can do everything
needful. It has already begun by excluding Rebels
from office. It must continue its jurisdiction; whether
through the war powers, or the duty to guaranty
a republican form of government, or the necessity of
the case, as in Territories, is a matter of little importance.
It is of less importance under which of its
powers this is done than that it is done. Continuing
its jurisdiction, Congress must supervise and fix the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
conditions of order, so that the National Security and
National Faith shall not suffer. Here is a sacred obligation
which cannot be postponed.</p>

<p>6. All these guaranties should be completed and
crowned by <i>an Amendment of the Constitution of the
United States</i>, especially providing that hereafter there
shall be no denial of the electoral franchise or any exclusion
of any kind on account of race or color, but all
persons shall be equal before the law. At this moment,
under a just interpretation of the Constitution,
three fourths of the States actually coöperating in the
National Government are sufficient for this change.
The words of the Constitution are, that Amendments
shall be valid to all intents and purposes, “when ratified
by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several
States,” or, according to practical sense, <i>by three fourths
of the States that have Legislatures</i>. If a State has no
Legislature, it cannot be counted in determining this
quorum, as it is not counted in determining the quorum
of either House of Congress, where precisely the same
question occurs. Any other interpretation recognizes
the Rebellion, and plays into its hands, by conceding
its power, through rebellious contrivance, to prevent an
Amendment of the Constitution essential to the general
welfare.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such are practical points to be observed in obtaining
the much needed guaranties. Congress will soon be in
session; and to its courageous conduct, in the exercise
of unquestionable powers, we all look with hope and
trust. Meanwhile the President, as commander-in-chief,
has large military powers, which may be exercised without
control until the meeting of Congress. To him I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
now appeal. Speaking from this platform, surrounded
by this concourse of his friends, and giving voice to
the sentiments of my heart, in harmony with the sentiments
of Massachusetts, I cannot fail in respect or
honor, while I address him with that plainness which
belongs to republican institutions:&mdash;</p>

<p>Sir, your power is vast. A word from you may
make an epoch. It may advance at once the cause
of Universal Civilization, or quicken anew the Satanic
energies of a fearful barbarism. It may give assurance
of security and reconciliation for the future, or it may
scatter uncertainty and distrust, while it postpones that
<i>Truce of God</i> which is the longing of our hearts. As
your power is vast, so is your responsibility. Act, we
entreat you, so that our country may have no fresh
sorrow. Do not hazard Emancipation, which is the
day-star of our age, and the special jewel in the crown
of your martyred predecessor, by any concession to its
enemies. Do not put in jeopardy all that we hold
most dear, by untimely attempt to bring back into
the national copartnership any of those ancient associates
who have warred upon their country. Let them
wait. You have said that treason is “crime,” and not
merely difference of opinion. Do not let the criminals
bear sway. The patriot dead cry out against such
surrender, and all their wounds bleed afresh. Congress
has set the example, by declaring that no person engaged
in the Rebellion shall hold office. For the present,
follow Congress. Follow the Constitution also,
which knows no distinction of color, and do not sacrifice
a whole race by resuscitating an offensive Black
Code, inconsistent with the National Security and the
National Faith. There also is the Declaration of Independence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
which now shines like the sun in the
heavens, rejoicing to penetrate every by-way and every
cabin, if you will not stand in its light. Let it shine,
until the Republic has completely dispelled that disgusting
pretension which is at once a stupendous
monopoly and an impious caste. Above all, do not
take from the loyal black man and give to the disloyal
white man; do not confiscate the political rights of
the freedman, who has shed his blood for us, and lavish
them upon his Rebel master. And remember that
justice to the colored race is the sheet-anchor of the
national credit.</p>

<p>Speaking always with the same frankness, I ask
leave to address the Secretary of War very briefly:&mdash;</p>

<p>Sir, there is yet room for your energies. That
region won to Union and Liberty by the victory you
organized must not be allowed to lapse under its
ancient masters, the perjured assertors of property in
man. It must not be abandoned. Let it be held by
arms until it smiles with the charities of life, and all
its people are guarded by an impenetrable shield.</p>

<p>And still speaking with equal plainness, I venture to
press one controlling consideration upon the Secretary
of the Treasury:&mdash;</p>

<p>Sir, you are the guardian of the national finances.
Use the peculiar influence belonging to this position
so that nothing shall be done to impair the National
Credit. See to it especially that no person is admitted
to political power in any Rebel community who
spurns the National Faith, sacredly plighted to the
national freedman as well as to the national creditor.
Such is the ordinance of Providence, that the fortunes
of the two are joined inseparably together. Credit is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
sensitive. It needs that all the resources of the country
should be brought into activity,&mdash;that agriculture
should be fostered, that commerce should be revived,
that emigration should be encouraged; but this cannot
be done without that <i>security</i> which is found in equal
laws and a contented people. The farmer, the merchant,
the emigrant must each feel secure. Land, capital,
and labor are of little value, except on this essential
condition. The loyal people who have contributed
so much, and now hold your bonds, trust that this
essential condition will not fail through any failure on
your part, and that you will not consent to open a
political volcano, spouting smoke and red-hot lava,
in an extended region whose first necessity is peace.
There is an order in all things; and any concession to
the criminal enemies of our country, until after the
confirmation of the National Security and the National
Faith, is simply an illustration, on a gigantic scale, of
the cart before the horse.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For myself, fellow-citizens, pardon me, if I say that
my course is fixed. Many may hesitate; many may
turn away from those great truths which make the far-reaching
brightness of the Republic; many may seek
a temporary favor by untimely surrender: I shall not.
The victory of blood, which has been so painfully won,
must be confirmed by a greater victory of ideas, so
that the renowned words of Abraham Lincoln may be
fulfilled, and “this nation, under God, shall have a new
birth of Freedom; and government of the people, <i>by the
people</i>, and for the people, shall not perish from the
earth.”<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> To this end I seek no merely formal Union,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
seething with smothered curses, but a practical, moral,
and political Unity, founded on common rights, knit
together by common interests, inspired by a common
faith, and throbbing with a common love of country,&mdash;where
our Constitution, interpreted anew, shall be
a covenant with Life and a league with Heaven,<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> and
Liberty shall be everywhere not only a right, but a
duty. John Brown, on his way to the scaffold, stooped
to take up a slave child. That closing example was
the legacy of the dying man to his country. That benediction
we must continue and fulfil. The last shall be
first; and so, in this new order, Equality, long postponed,
shall become the master principle of our system
and the very frontispiece of our Constitution. The
Rebellion was to beat down this principle, by founding
a government on the alleged inferiority of a race.
The attempt has failed, but not, alas! the insolent assumption
of the conspirators. Pursuing our victory,
I now insist that this assumption shall be trampled
out. A righteous government cannot be founded on
any exclusion of race. This is not the first time that
I have battled with the barbarism of Slavery. I battle
still, as the bloody monster retreats to its last citadel;
and, God willing, I mean to hold on, if it takes what
remains to me of life.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>The appearance and condition of Andrew Johnson before the Senate,
and representatives of foreign powers, when taking the oath as Vice-President,
March 4, 1865, was not calculated to inspire general confidence.
But, in the absence of further display of the same kind, the public
had become silent, hoping something better. The memory of that
incident threw a shadow over the great office he was called to assume.
Some were favorably affected by the avowals of patriotism in numerous
off-hand speeches, although touching but a single chord. Nothing
was said of the great principles of Reconstruction, but treason was to
be made “odious.” The repetition of himself impressed Chief Justice
Chase, as well as Mr. Sumner, and he said to the latter, “Let us see
the President, and try to give him another topic.” So, in company, at
an early hour of the evening, about a week after the commencement of
his Presidency, they called, and united in urging him to say something
for the equal rights of our colored fellow-citizens. Though reserved in
language, he was not unsympathetic in manner, so that, after the interview,
the Chief Justice, on reaching the street, said: “Did you see
how his face lighted at your appeal to carry out the Declaration of
Independence?” A few days later Mr. Sumner called alone, and received
from the President positive assurance of agreement on the suffrage
question. His words were, “On this question, Mr. Sumner,
there is no difference between us,&mdash;you and I are alike.” An account
of these interviews, and the sequel, was subsequently given in an address
at Boston, October 2, 1866.</p>

<p>Very soon it was too apparent that the President had adopted an
opposite course. States were to be hurried back by Presidential prerogative
on the electoral basis anterior to the war. Mr. Sumner from
the beginning had regarded the votes of colored fellow-citizens necessary
to a proper reconstruction,&mdash;first, as an act of justice to them,
and, secondly, as a counterpoise to the disloyal. He had urged this
solution in the Senate, and had repeatedly presented it to President
Lincoln. The Diary of Hon. Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
according to an article published by him,<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> shows how Mr. Sumner
pressed this duty in the most intimate councils. It appears that this
Secretary was at the War Department, Sunday evening, April 16th, the
day after President Lincoln’s death, where he met Speaker Colfax, Mr.
Covode, the very earnest Representative from Pennsylvania, Messrs.
Dawes and Gooch, Representatives of Massachusetts, and Mr. Sumner.
After stating that Mr. Stanton read to them the drafts of orders for
the reorganization of Virginia and North Carolina, the article proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Before concluding that which related to North Carolina, Mr. Sumner
interrupted the reading, and requested Mr. Stanton to stop until he could
understand whether any provision was made for enfranchising the colored
man. Unless, said he, the black man is given the right to vote, his freedom
is mockery.</p>

<p>“Mr. Stanton said there were differences among our friends on that subject,
and it would be unwise, in his judgment, to press it in this stage of the
proceedings.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sumner declared he would not proceed a step, unless the black man
had his rights. He considered the black man’s right to vote the essence,
the great essential.”</p>

</div>

<p>In conformity with this declaration Mr. Sumner continued to act, as
appears in correspondence and speech. His Eulogy on President Lincoln,
at the request of the municipal authorities of Boston, was an
appeal for the black man. So also was his private correspondence,
during this summer, with Secretary Stanton, Secretary McCulloch, Secretary
Welles, Secretary Harlan, and Attorney-General Speed, all of
the Cabinet.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the President went forward in his “policy.” The country
was alarmed. Hon. Thaddeus Stevens, the acknowledged leader
of the House of Representatives, partook of the anxiety which ensued.
Though not yet prepared to press the ballot for all, he was strenuous
against the assumption and precipitation of the President.</p>

<p>As early as May 10th he wrote to Mr. Sumner, from Philadelphia:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I see the President is precipitating things. Virginia is recognized.
I fear before Congress meets he will have so bedevilled matters as to render
them incurable. It would be well, if he would call an extra session
of Congress. But I almost despair of resisting Executive influence.”</p>

</div>

<p>This was followed by another letter, under date of June 3d, from
Caledonia, Penn., where were his iron-works:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Is it possible to devise any plan to arrest the Government in its mad
career? When will you be in Washington? Can’t we enlist bold men
enough to lay the foundation of a party to take the helm of this Government
and keep it off the rocks?”</p>

</div>

<p>Then, under date of June 14th, another, also from Caledonia:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Is there no way to arrest the insane course of the President in ‘reorganization’?
Can you get up a movement in Massachusetts? I have
thought of trying it in our State Convention. If something is not done, the
President will be crowned king before Congress meets. How absurd his
interfering with the internal regulations of the States, and yet considering
them as ‘States in the Union’!”</p>

</div>

<p>Also, under date of August 17th, from Caledonia:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have written very plainly to the President, urging delay. But I fear
he will pursue his wrong course. With illegal courts and usurping ‘reconstruction,’
I know not where you and I shall be. While we can hardly
approve all the acts of the Government, we must try and keep out of the
ranks of the Opposition. The danger is that so much success will reconcile
the people to almost anything.”</p>

</div>

<p>August 26th, Mr. Stevens wrote from his home at Lancaster, Penn.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am glad you are laboring to avert the President’s fatal policy. I wish
the prospect of success were better. I have twice written him, urging him
to stay his hand until Congress meets. Of course he pays no attention to
it. Our editors are generally cowardly sycophants. I would make a speech,
as you suggest, if a fair occasion offered. Our views (‘Reconstruction and
Confiscation’) were embodied in our resolutions [in the Republican State
Convention, recently held] at Harrisburg, amidst much chaff. Negro suffrage
was passed over, as heavy and premature. Get the Rebel States into a
territorial condition, and it can be easily dealt with. That, I think, should
be our great aim. Then Congress can manage it.”</p>

</div>

<p>In the same spirit, Hon. B. F. Wade, of the Senate of the United
States, July 29th, wrote from his home at Jefferson, Ohio:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I regret to say, that, with regard to the policy resolved upon by the
President, I have no consolation to impart. To me all appears gloomy.…
The salvation of the country devolves upon Congress and against
the Executive. Will they be able to resist the downward tendency of
events? My experience is not calculated to inspire me with confidence.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. Henry Winter Davis, the able, eloquent, and courageous Representative
in Congress from Baltimore, June 20th, in a long letter to
Mr. Sumner, on our perils and duties, wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“One way is to pass a law by two-thirds over the President’s veto, prescribing
the conditions of reconstruction of any State government, and
declaring <i>none</i> republican in form which excludes negroes from voting.
Such a law the President will be obliged to obey and execute.… The
other mode of solving the problem, over the head of the President, is to pass
an Amendment of the Constitution prescribing universal suffrage.… We
have the requisite majority to pursue either of these plans; but is there
nerve for the work? I have too often failed to inspire my political friends
with that elevated sense of their own authority to dictate the course of
affairs, to be sanguine of success in measures which require so much unity,
energy, and singleness of purpose as these. The last Congress was not
equal to it; is the present Congress?… Now do me the favor to give
me your views as fully as I have given you mine. I trust you are not, as I
am, in despair.”<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p>In the course of the summer a pamphlet was published in Boston,
entitled “Security and Reconciliation for the Future: Propositions
and Arguments on the Reorganization of the Rebel States,”&mdash;being
a collection of resolutions by Mr. Sumner, with the article in the <i>Atlantic
Monthly</i>,<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> the speech on the admission of Senators from Arkansas,<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>

drew attention, and helped prepare for the speech at the State Convention.
A few extracts will show its reception.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Dr. George B. Loring, the agriculturist, afterwards Chairman of the
State Committee of the Republican party in Massachusetts, and President
of the Massachusetts Senate, wrote from Salem:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I only wish all our statesmen had taken the ground adopted by yourself;
it would have saved us infinite trouble. It entitles you to eternal
thanks, and receives daily more and more assent.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. John C. Underwood, District Judge of the United States, wrote
from Alexandria, Va.:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have read your collected arguments on the subject of Reconstruction
with great pleasure and profit. Let me thank you for convincing me, very
much against my will, that to allow immediate representation to the Rebel
States would be a cruel breach of faith and honor to the freedmen, and that
we of the South must be just to these poor people, and submit to a genuine
republican government, before we deserve admission again into the American
family. I trust no petty personal ambition will prevent my full appreciation
of the immensely important work for our country and humanity
which you have so well performed.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. Charles Eames, the able lawyer and scholar, former Commissioner
to the Sandwich Islands, and Minister at Venezuela, residing in
Washington, wrote from the sea-shore at Long Branch:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is a noble monumental record, worthy both of the subject and of
the Senator, and which will stand a landmark in our parliamentary history.
Every new day, as it comes, brings new attestation of your wisdom
and foresight, and of the truthful views which from the first, and almost, if
not altogether, alone in Congress, you took and faithfully expounded on the
whole question of Reconstruction. The idea of hurrying these lately Rebel
communities into participation in the enactment and administration of our
laws seems to me the most absurd blunder ever perpetrated in history, with
the possible exception of that earlier and still more monstrous enormity of
error which assigned to them the right to give by silence a negative vote on
the purposed change of our fundamental law.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. John Y. Smith, an able and independent thinker, wrote from
Madison, Wisconsin:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Pray, honored Sir, do not be discouraged by the stupid prejudices with
which you have to contend, but fight it out, and you may save the nation;
for at no time during the war was it in greater peril than it is at this moment.
The Ship of State has gallantly borne up through the storms of war,
but I fear that President Johnson, with the best intentions, is running her
straight upon the rocks.”</p>

</div>

<p>A few extracts from newspapers attest the impression made by the
Speech.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Boston <i>Transcript</i>, which reported the speech on the afternoon
of its delivery, said:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. Sumner has made many powerful addresses, on many important
occasions; but we think our readers will admit that he has never presented
a more masterly argument, on a more important occasion, than that which
he has urged on the Union Republicans in his speech of to-day. Clear and
pointed in statement, felicitous in illustration, admirable in arrangement,
cogent in logic, affluent in learning, with occasional bursts of eloquence
which light up and animate, but never disturb, the course of the argument,
the speech cannot fail to exert an immense influence on the formation of
that public opinion which is to determine the mode by which one of the
most momentous questions ever brought before the American people shall
be definitely settled.… Mr. Sumner does not merely attempt to convince
the understanding; he strikes through it to the national conscience
and sense of humanity and honor. His sentences are full of heat, as well as
light,&mdash;will lodge in the minds they inform, and influence the will which
votes, as well as the judgment which assents.”</p>

</div>

<p>The Albany <i>Morning Express</i> said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Let us call Senator Sumner a fanatic, if we will; let us pronounce him
a man of one idea, if we choose; but let us at least award him the honor
he deserves.… If Charles Sumner is wrong, his example is right. We
have not so many politicians true to eternal principle, we have not so many
statesmen devoted with a single purpose even to their own conception of the
best interests of the country, we have not so many counsellors studious only
of strict justice, that we can afford to throw away the Senator from Massachusetts.
Whether we regard him as right or wrong, there is something
sublime in his steady, persistent, unwavering devotion to his idea. Such
honesty cannot be impugned. Such fidelity cannot be misinterpreted.…
Senator Sumner has always been in advance of the mass. He is a leader a
long way ahead, a pioneer through trackless mazes. It is his mission to
discover a path where the throng shall follow.”</p>

</div>

<p>With different spirit, the New York <i>Herald</i>, in an article entitled
“Senator Sumner on the Rampage,” said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We now have an essay from Senator Sumner, who, mounted on his
‘Bay horse,’ makes a furious assault upon the President and his policy,
and, in fact, everybody, except the blacks in the South.… He is determined
to fight it out, if it takes the remainder of his life. The public
now know his position, and just what the Jacobins intend to do. The
President can also understand the nature of the opposition which he is to
have arrayed against him in the next Congress.… The Rebellion, he
declares, is not ended, nor Slavery abolished. If he means by the former
term Northern rebellion, he is not far out of the way; for it is very evident
that a rebellion has commenced in the North, and has been inaugurated
in Massachusetts, with Senator Sumner as high-priest and prophet.”</p>

</div>

<p>The New York <i>World</i>, in an article entitled “The Massachusetts
Declaration of War against the President,” said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is not worth while to spend words on the formal resolves of the Massachusetts
Convention. They but condense, in more staid and decorous
language, the sentiments of Mr. Sumner’s speech; and we prefer to dip
out of the fountain. The unanimous election of Mr. Sumner as the presiding
officer, the applause which greeted his speech, the panegyrics lavished
upon it by the Republican press of Boston, and its harmony with every
public utterance in Massachusetts, from the Faneuil Hall meeting in May
down, are so many seals of its authentication as a true exposition of the
purposes of the Republican party. Charles Sumner is the Republican platform
incarnate.”</p>

</div>

<p>Other papers show how it was received in States lately in rebellion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span></p>

<p>The Memphis <i>Argus</i>, of Tennessee, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Yesterday we received, under the frank of ‘C. Sumner,’ his recent
infamous speech at Worcester, Massachusetts. We use the word <i>infamous</i>
advisedly, temperately; for viler or more wilful and malicious slanders of
a great, suffering, and submissive people, vanquished in war by overwhelming
odds, but honestly accepting all the legitimate results of their defeat,
and patriotically anxious to resume their old places in a full, restored
Union, were never published to the world by the filthiest political scavenger
that ever plied his trade in the foul services of party.”</p>

</div>

<p>The Augusta <i>Transcript</i>, of Georgia, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To show the infamous slanders to which the fanatical leaders are
obliged to resort, in order to goad on their followers to the new crusade
against the South, we republish an extract from Mr. Sumner’s last speech
in Massachusetts.”</p>

</div>

<p>In England, Colonel T. Perronet Thompson, the Freetrader, and
former Member of Parliament, in his series of articles in the Bradford
<i>Advertiser</i>, after enumerating the topics, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The man who has no curiosity to know what the first statesman in
America says on all these heads would go to bed without asking whether
the fire in the next street was put out, or if the house next his own began
to smoke. The very jobbers in Rebel bonds, or builders of the Shenandoah,
might feel a desire to know which way the thing was going.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Scotsman</i>, a foremost journal at Edinburgh, commenced a leader
on this speech as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It would be at least difficult to name a man in the United States, or
rather the States now under process of being reunited, who is better entitled
to a respectful hearing, all the world over, than Mr. Charles Sumner. He
has had but one object,&mdash;a noble object, worthy any calculable amount of
struggle and sacrifice; and he has pursued it ardently, bravely, disregarding
both party and personal consequences, and letting no other object stand in
the way or turn him aside for a moment from the straight path. He has
sought only the Abolition of Slavery, and has deemed nothing else worth
fighting for.”</p>

</div>

<p>The response by correspondence was prompt and earnest from various
parts of the country. The letters from which extracts are taken,
with the exception of that from Great Salt Lake City, were received
immediately after the delivery of the speech.</p>

<p>“After an absence from good old Massachusetts of eleven years, my
heart was made glad, the other day, by seeing a notice in the papers that
you were to speak at the Republican Convention at Worcester. I immediately
hastened thither, and felt happy beyond measure, as I listened to the
deafening applause with which your appearance upon the platform was
greeted.”</p>

<p>Rev. John T. Sargent, the Liberal clergyman, wrote from Boston:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That noble speech of yours at the Worcester Convention, so complete

<p>“Let me express the earnest hope that you will economize your strength
for the great conflict soon to come during the approaching Congress. I
never doubted the final success of our arms; but when the sword should be

with slaveholders. We shall quite need all your prudence, forecast, energy,
courage, and decision, to meet the dangers ahead from returning Rebels.”</p>

<p>Rev. Charles Brooks, eminent for his services to education, wrote
from Medford:&mdash;</p>

my hearing, from the most honorable and intelligent of your political opponents
from the South, declarations attributing those qualities to you in an
eminent degree, giving you credit for consistency and unmistakable integrity
of purpose. Your exertions have in a very great degree contributed
towards the defeat of the Rebellion and the victory of the Government

the condensation of Calhoun, the strength of Webster, and more than
the eloquence of Clay. In logic, in illustration, in simplicity of truth, I have
never read a state-paper that equals it. Its timely utterance how fortunate
for the country! He inspires some of the most vital parts of the
Constitution (which heretofore have been a dead letter) with new life and
activity. Washington and Lincoln led in the first and second revolutions,
but it was left for Charles Sumner to lead in the third,&mdash;a revolution in

<h2><a name="QUORUM_OF_STATES_NECESSARY_IN_ADOPTION" id="QUORUM_OF_STATES_NECESSARY_IN_ADOPTION"></a>QUORUM OF STATES NECESSARY IN ADOPTION
OF A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Letter to the New York Evening Post, September 28, 1865.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">To the Editor of the New York Evening Post.</span></p>

<p class="dropcap">As a faithful reader of the “Evening Post” for many
years, I have perused your article insisting that
all present effort for guaranties of national security and
national faith must be postponed, in order to obtain the
ratification of the Constitutional Amendment by which
slavery is abolished throughout the United States. If
the Constitutional Amendment were not already ratified
by the requisite number of States, I should doubt if
even this most desirable object could be a sufficient excuse
for leaving the national freedman and the national
creditor exposed to peril, when exertions now can save
them. But allow me to inquire if you do not forget,
that, according to usage of the National Government
in analogous cases, this Amendment has been already
ratified by the requisite number of States, so that at
this moment it is valid, to all intents and purposes, as
part of the Constitution? There was a butcher once
who looked everywhere for his knife, forgetting that he
held it between his teeth; there also was the good Dr.
Dove, who was in love without knowing it; and you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
have laughed, I am sure, at the story told by Southey
to illustrate this condition, where the traveller, asking
how far it was to a place called “The Pan,” was answered
directly, “You be in the Pan now.” It seems
to me, that, like the traveller, the doctor, and the
butcher, you already have what you desire; so that,
even according to your programme, the way is clear
for insisting upon those other things embraced under
“Security for the Future.”</p>

<p>The Constitution of the United States decides that
“the Congress, whenever <i>two thirds of both Houses</i> shall
deem it necessary, shall propose amendments to this
Constitution, … which shall be valid, to all intents
and purposes, as part of this Constitution, when ratified
by <i>the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States</i>.”
On these words the simple question arises, What constitutes
the quorum?</p>

<p>But the usage of the National Government in analogous
cases has determined that the quorum is founded
on the States <i>actually participating in the Government</i>.
This has been decided in both Houses of Congress. The
House of Representatives led the way in fixing its
quorum <i>according to actual representation</i>, or, in other
words, at “a majority of the members chosen.”<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> The
Senate, after careful consideration and protracted debate,
followed in establishing a similar rule.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> The Constitutional
Amendment was adopted by both houses
<i>organized according to this rule</i>. The national debt has
been sanctioned by both houses <i>thus organized</i>. Treaties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
also with foreign powers have been sanctioned in the
Senate <i>thus organized</i>.</p>

<p>Applying this rule, the quorum of States requisite
for the ratification of the Constitutional Amendment is
plainly three fourths of the States <i>actually participating
in the Government</i>, or, in other words, three fourths of
the States having “Legislatures.” Where a State has
no Legislature, it may be still a State, but it cannot
be practically counted in the organization of Congress;
and I submit that the same rule must prevail in the
ratification of the Constitutional Amendment. The reason
of the rule is the same in each case. If you insist
upon counting a rebel State, having no Legislature,
you make a concession to rebellion. You concede to
a mutinous State the power to arrest, it may be, the
organization of Congress, or, it may be, amendments to
the Constitution important to the general welfare. This
is not reasonable. Therefore, on grounds of reason as
well as usage, I prefer the accepted rule.</p>

<p>If this conclusion needed the support of authority,
it would find it in the declared opinion of one of our
best law-writers, who is cited with respect in all the
courts of the country. I refer to Mr. Bishop, who, in
the third edition of his “Commentaries on the Criminal
Law,” published within a few days, discusses this question
at length. In the course of his remarks he uses
the following language:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span> “If the matter were one relating
to any other subject than Slavery, no legal person
would ever doubt, that, when there are States with
Legislatures and States without Legislatures, and the
Constitution submits a question to the determination of
‘the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States,’
the meaning is, three fourths of the States which have
Legislatures. In fact, it does not require either legal
wisdom or legal acumen to see this, provided we look
at the point disconnected from the peculiar subject of
Slavery.”<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> The learned author then proceeds to illustrate
this statement in a manner to which I can see
no answer.</p>

<p>To my mind all this seems so plain that I am disposed
to ask pardon for arguing it. Of course there is
no question whether a State is <i>in</i> the Union or <i>out of</i>
the Union. It is enough that it is without a Legislature,
and on this point there can be no question.
Being without a Legislature, it cannot be counted in
determining the quorum.</p>

<p>Therefore, beyond all dispute, the Constitutional
Amendment has been already ratified by the requisite
number of States; so that Slavery is now constitutionally
abolished twice,&mdash;first, by the Proclamation
of President Lincoln, under the war powers of the
National Constitution; and, secondly, by Constitutional
Amendment. It remains that we should provide supplementary
safeguards, and complete the good work
that has been begun, by taking care that Slavery is
abolished in spirit as well as letter, and that the freedmen
are protected by further needed guaranties. Without
this additional provision, I see small prospect of
that peace and reconciliation which are the object so
near our hearts.</p>

EQUESTRIAN STATUE OF COLONEL SHAW, FIRST COMMANDER

<p class="dropcap">The two colored regiments enlisted, equipped, and
sent forth by Massachusetts have returned home
and been mustered out. Officers and privates are now
dispersed. The last music has died away. Of these
two famous regiments, which made such a mark on the
times, nothing now remains but the memory. This cannot
die; for it belongs to the history of a race. But all
who went have not returned. The youthful hero, so
gentle and true, who was selected by the Governor to
command the Fifty-Fourth Regiment, fell at the head of
his men on the very parapets of the Rebel enemy, and
was buried in the sand with his humble companions
in arms,&mdash;thus in death, as in life, sharing their fortunes.
Family, parents, wife, were left to mourn. As
was said of “Bonnie George Campbell,” in the beautiful
Scotch ballad,&mdash;</p>

<div class="verse">“Hame cam’ his gude horse,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">But never cam’ he.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Few who were in Boston at the time can forget that
pleasant day in May, when this colored regiment, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
Colonel Shaw riding proudly at its head, passed by the
State-House, where it had been equipped and inspired.
Cheers and the waving of handkerchiefs greeted it.
There were tears also. It was a joyous and a sad sight
to see this new legion, acquired to the national service,
promptly marching to its distant and perilous duty, under
a commander who, turning away from the blandishments
of life, consecrates himself to his country.
Nor was another consecration forgotten. It was to the
redemption of a race. Massachusetts had sent forth
many brave regiments; but here was the first regiment
of colored soldiers marshalled at the North. It was
an experiment, destined to be an epoch. By the success
of this regiment a whole race was elevated. As
he went forth, it became less an incident of war than
an act of magnanimity and moral grandeur. Sidney,
who refused the cup of cold water, was one of our
young hero’s predecessors.</p>

<p>Not long after came tidings of the bloody assault
on Fort Wagner, when, by an advance without parallel
over an open beach, exposed to a storm of shot
and shell, these new-made soldiers of a despised color,
sleepless, dinnerless, supperless, vindicated their title as
bravest of the brave. They had done what no other
troops had done during the war. This was their
Bunker Hill, and Shaw was their martyred Warren.
Though defeated, they were yet victorious. The regiment
was driven back; but the cause was advanced.
The country learned to know colored troops, and they
learned to know themselves. From that day of conflict
nobody doubted their capacity or courage as soldiers.
There was sorrow in Massachusetts as we were told
how many had fallen, and that the beloved officer so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
recently admired in our streets was sleeping in an unknown
grave; but even this sorrow did not blind an
intelligent people to the magnitude of the event. Grief
was chastened by honest pride. Swelling hearts were
soothed by the thought that much had been done for
humanity.</p>

<p>A desire arose at once for a monument to commemorate
alike the hero and the event. But the Rebellion
was then raging. It was no time for monuments. At
last, with the overthrow of the Rebel arms, the time
seems to have arrived. The youthful commander still
sleeps with his comrades in death. There let him sleep.
Westminster Abbey has no resting-place more honorable.
But his patriotic sacrifice and the great event
deserve commemoration, as well for gratitude as for
example. Some propose a monument on the spot
where he fell. This may be made; but it can be only
a mound or pile of stones, to be seen by ships as they
enter the harbor of Charleston. This is not enough.
It will not tell the whole story.</p>

<p>The monument should be in Massachusetts, where
the hero was born, and where the regiment was also
born. Each belonged to Massachusetts,&mdash;the martyr
by double title: first, as he drew his breath here, and,
secondly, as he commanded this regiment of Massachusetts.
Let the monument be here. Of course, no
common stone or shaft will be sufficient. It must be of
bronze. It must be an equestrian statue. And there is
a place for it. Let it stand on one of the stone terraces
of the steps ascending from Beacon Street to the State-House.
It was in the State-House that the regiment
was equipped and inspired. It was from the State-House
that the devoted commander rode to death. Let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
future generations, as long as bronze shall endure, look
upon him there riding always, and be taught by his example
to succor the oppressed and to surrender life for
duty. Especially let legislators of Massachusetts, by
daily sight of the symbolic statue, be gratefully led
to constant support of the cause for which he died.
Here is a theme for Art, and its elements are youth,
beauty, self-sacrifice, death, and a great cause.</p>

<p>On the Continent of Europe, by general usage, only
members of a royal family are allowed the honor of
an equestrian statue. In the unequalled monument by
Rauch, at Berlin, the royal Fritz is mounted, but his
generals are about him standing. Near by is Blücher,
who was prince and marshal, also standing. In England
there are equestrian statues of kings, and of the
Duke of Wellington. But this is no reason why a
grateful people should not decree an equestrian statue
to a youthful hero, whose duty was on horseback, and
who was last seen in our streets on horseback. As an
American citizen he belonged to our sovereignty, and
we fitly celebrate him with the highest honors. Few
belonging to any royal family have so good a title. In
the Republics of Italy, during the early ages, when royalty
did not exist, there were equestrian statues. The
first of these in merit, and one of the first in time, was
the renowned statue in bronze of the <i>condottiere</i> Bartolommeo
Coleoni, who, after a lapse of centuries, is
still admired as he rides bravely in a public square of
Venice, while the artist has secured the immortality of
his own name by engraving it upon the girth of the
saddle. It is sometimes said, on doubtful authority,
that this early chieftain was the first to mount cannon
on wheels, so that they could be used in the field. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
our chieftain did more than mount cannon, and the
triumphant experiment with which his name is linked
surpasses far anything in the life of an Italian trooper.
His act was above any triumph of battle. It was a
victory of ideas, and belongs to the sacred history of
Humanity.</p>

<p>Let the monument be made. Boston has a sculptor
without a superior among living artists, whose soul and
genius would be in the work. Already a colored person,
well known among us, with a heart full of gratitude,
has subscribed five hundred dollars. Other colored
persons are contributing in smaller sums, according
to their means. They properly lead now in tribute
to him who died in leading them. But others of ampler
means must see that this generous effort does not fail.
I should not suggest this, if I thought that I should
take away from other things deserving aid. The present
charity is so peculiar, that it appeals equally to all
who are moved by patriotism, by gratitude, by sympathy,
or by Art.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>This article was followed by a public meeting in the Council Chamber
of the State-House, at the invitation of Governor Andrew, to consider
the proposition of an equestrian statue in honor of Colonel Shaw.
The following committee was appointed to collect subscriptions and
superintend the erection of the statue: John A. Andrew, Charles Sumner,
Joshua B. Smith, Charles R. Codman, Samuel G. Howe, Robert
B. Storer, Frederick W. Lincoln, Jr., James L. Little, William W.
Clapp, Jr., Charles Beck, Rev. Leonard A. Grimes, Peleg W. Chandler,
William G. Weld, Edward Atkinson, Charles W. Slack, Robert
E. Apthorp, Henry Lee, Jr., Edward W. Kinsley, George B. Loring,
LeBaron Russell, Henry I. Bowditch.</p>

<p>At a meeting of this committee, Charles Sumner, Samuel G. Howe,
Charles Beck, George B. Loring, LeBaron Russell, Henry I. Bowditch,
and Charles R. Codman were appointed a sub-committee to select an
artist, to contract with him, to secure a proper place for the statue,
and to superintend its erection.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Boston</span>, October 5, 1865.</p>

<p class="dropcap">MY DEAR MADAM,&mdash;I have been charged by the
State Convention of the Republicans of Massachusetts,
over which I had the honor of presiding, to
communicate to you resolutions unanimously adopted
by them, expressing their grateful regard for the memory
of your late husband, and their sympathy in your
bereavement.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>Knowing Mr. Cobden personally, as I did for many
years, and corresponding with him on public questions,
I confess a sense of personal loss beyond even that of
my fellow-citizens. He was the good friend of my
country, and he was my own private friend. Therefore,
in making this communication, I desire to express
my own individual grief.</p>

<p>His lamented death has caused a chasm not only in
his own home and country, but here in the United
States. We all miss him and mourn him. He was a
wise and good man. An Englishman by birth, his heart
and all his faculties were given to mankind, knowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
well that the welfare and true glory of his own great
country were best assured by such a dedication.</p>

<p>Hoping that you may be consoled in your sorrow,
and that your children may be blessed in life, I ask
you to accept the respect with which I have the honor
to be, dear Madam,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Sumner</span>,&mdash;On behalf of myself and my children, I beg
most kindly to thank you, and the members of the Republican State Convention
of Massachusetts, for the resolutions, passed by them, of sympathy
with us in our terrible bereavement.</p>

<p>These resolutions are rendered more valuable by the letter from yourself
which accompanies them.</p>

<p>The expressions of sympathy and condolence which have reached us
from public bodies and private individuals, in your and other countries,
have been deeply grateful to my stricken heart; for they assure me of the
wide-spread appreciation of the efforts of my beloved husband to promote
the cause of international prosperity and peace.</p>

<p>From America they are especially grateful; for his sympathy with the
cause of liberty to the slave was undoubted and intense. And it was on
his way to Parliament, to speak on the Canadian question in its relation
to the American Union, that he contracted the illness which ended his
dear and noble life.</p>

<p>Pray accept the kindest remembrances of myself and children, and believe
me to remain,</p>

IN RECONSTRUCTION.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Letter To the New York Independent, October 29, 1865.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Boston</span>, October 29, 1865.</p>

<p class="dropcap">DEAR MR. EDITOR,&mdash;I rejoice that “The Independent”
has planted itself firmly on the sure
ground of Equal Rights. It is natural that a journal
which has from the beginning so bravely and constantly
opposed Slavery in all its pretensions should now
insist that these pretensions shall be trampled out, so
that nothing shall be left to breed future trouble. This
can be done only through the establishment of Equal
Rights.</p>

<p>To my mind, there never was a duty plainer or more
instinctive. It is plain as the Moral Law, and it is instinctive
as self-defence. If the country fails to do this
justice now, it will commit a crime where guilt and
meanness strive for mastery. On this head it is enough
to say that it is a debt we owe to saviours and benefactors.
But here all the instincts of self-defence harmonize
with justice.</p>

<p>For the sake of the whole country, which suffers
from weakness in any part,&mdash;for the sake of the States
lately distracted by war, which above all things need
security and repose,&mdash;for the sake of agriculture, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
is neglected there,&mdash;for the sake of commerce, which
has fled,&mdash;for the sake of the national creditor, whose
generous trust is exposed to repudiation,&mdash;and, finally,
for the sake of reconciliation, which can be complete
only when justice prevails, we must insist upon Equal
Rights as the condition of the new order of things.
So long as this question remains unsettled, there can
be no true peace. Therefore I would say to the merchant,
who wishes to open trade with this region,&mdash;to
the capitalist, who would send his money there,&mdash;to
the emigrant, who seeks to find a home there,&mdash;begin
by assuring justice to all men. This is the one essential
condition of prosperity, of credit, and of tranquillity.
Without this, mercantile houses, banks, and emigration
societies, having anything to do with this region,
must all fail, or at least suffer in business and
resources.</p>

<p>To Congress we must look as guardian, under the
Constitution, of the national safety. I do not doubt
its full power over the whole subject; nor do I doubt
its duty to see that every pretended government organized
by recent Rebels is treated as a present nullity.
President Johnson then spoke well, when in Tennessee
he said that “in the work of reorganization Rebels
must take back seats, leaving place to those who have
been truly loyal.” There is the key-note of a just policy,
which I trust Congress will adopt.</p>

<p>It is difficult to measure the mischief already accumulating
from the policy that has been pursued.
Looking at the positive loss to business and the productive
industry of the country, it is painful. Looking
at the distress it has caused among loyal people
by the revival of the Rebel spirit, it is heart-rending.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
Looking at it in any way, it is a terrible failure. It
will be for Congress to apply the remedy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile you have the thanks of good people for
your loyalty to the cause, and your strenuous efforts in
its behalf. Go on, I entreat you, nor ever hesitate.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Here are two famous verses, both often quoted,
and one a commonplace of literature. That they
have passed into proverbs attests their merit both in
substance and in form. Something more than truth is
needed for a proverb. And so, also, something more
than form is needed. Both must concur. The truth
must be expressed in such form as to satisfy the requirements
of Art.</p>

<p>Most persons, who have not occasionally indulged in
such diversions, if asked where these verses are to be
found, would say at once that it was in some familiar
poet of school-boy days. Both have a sound as of
something heard in childhood. The latter is Virgilian
in tone and movement. More than once I have heard
it insisted that it was by Virgil. But nobody is able
to find it there, although the opposite dangers are
represented in the voyage of Æneas:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Dextrum Scylla latus, lævum implacata Charybdis Obsidet.”<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span></p>

<p>Another poet shows the peril without the contrast:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Scylla, et Charybdis Sicula contorquens freta</div>
<div class="verse">Minus est timenda: nulla non melior fera est.”<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thinking of the historical proverb, I am reminded of
the eminent character who first showed it to me in the
heroic poem where it appears. I refer to the late Dr.
Maltby, Bishop of Durham, who had been a favorite
pupil of Dr. Parr, and was unquestionably among the
best scholars of England. His amenity was equal to
his scholarship. I was his guest at Auckland Castle
early in the autumn of 1838. Conversation turned
much upon books and the curiosities of study. One
morning, after breakfast, the learned Bishop came to
me with a small volume in his hand, printed in the
Italian character, and remarking, “You seem to be interested
in such things,” he pointed to this much quoted
verse. It was the Latin epic, “Alexandreïs, sive Gesta
Alexandri Magni,” by Philippus Gualterus, a mediæval
poet of France.</p>

<p>Of course the fable of Scylla and Charybdis is ancient;
but this verse cannot be traced to antiquity.
For the fable Homer is our highest authority, and he
represents the Sirens as unfriendly accessories, playing
their part to tempt the victim.</p>

<p>These fronting terrors belong to mythology and to
geography. Mythologically, they were two voracious
monsters, dwelling opposite to each other,&mdash;Charybdis
on the coast of Sicily, and Scylla on the coast of Italy.
Geographically, they were dangers to the navigator in
the narrow strait between Sicily and Italy. Charybdis
was a whirlpool, where ships were often sucked to destruction;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
Scylla was a rock, on which ships were often
dashed to pieces.</p>

<p>Ulysses in his wanderings encountered these terrors,
but by prudence and the counsels of Circe he was enabled
to steer clear between them, although the Sirens
strove to lure him on the rock. The story is too long;
but there are passages like pictures, and they have been
illustrated by the genius of Flaxman. The first danger
on the Sicilian side is described in the Odyssey:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Beneath, Charybdis holds her boisterous reign</div>
<div class="verse">’Midst roaring whirlpools, and absorbs the main;</div>
<div class="verse">Thrice in her gulfs the boiling seas subside,</div>
<div class="verse">Thrice in dire thunders she refunds the tide.”<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Endeavoring to shun this peril, the navigator encounters
the other:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Here Scylla bellows from her dire abodes,</div>
<div class="verse">Tremendous pest, abhorred by man and gods!</div>
<div class="verse center">…</div>
<div class="verse">Six horrid necks she rears, and six terrific heads;</div>
<div class="verse">Her jaws grin dreadful with three rows of teeth;</div>
<div class="verse">Jaggy they stand, the gaping den of Death.”<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Not far off were the Sirens, who strove by their music
to draw the navigator to certain doom:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Their song is death, and makes destruction please.</div>
<div class="verse">Unblest the man whom music wins to stay</div>
<div class="verse">Nigh the cursed shore and listen to the lay:</div>
<div class="verse">No more that wretch shall view the joys of life,</div>
<div class="verse">His blooming offspring or his beauteous wife!”<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Forewarned, the wise Ulysses took all precautions
against the fatal perils. Avoiding the Sicilian whirlpool,
he did not run upon the Italian rock or yield to
the voice of the charmer. And yet he could not renounce
the opportunity of hearing the melody. Stuffing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
the ears of his companions with wax, so that they
could not be entranced by the Sirens, or comprehend
any countermanding order which his weakness might
induce him to utter, he had himself tied to the mast,&mdash;like
another Farragut,&mdash;and directed that the ship
should be steered straight on. It was steered straight
on, although he cried out to stop. His deafened companions
heard nothing of the song or the countermand,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Till, dying off, the distant sounds decay.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The dangers of both coasts were at length passed, not
without the loss of six men, “chiefs of renown,” who
became the prey of Scylla. But the Sirens, humbled
by defeat, dashed themselves upon the rocks and disappeared
forever.</p>

<p>Few stories have been more popular. It was natural
that it should enter into poetry and suggest a proverb.
St. Augustine uses it, when he says, “<i>Ne iterum, quasi
fugiens Charybdim, in Scyllam incurras</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> Milton more
than once alludes to it. Thus, in the exquisite “Comus,”
he shows these opposite terrors subdued by another
power:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent14">“Scylla wept</div>
<div class="verse">And chid her barking waves into attention,</div>
<div class="verse">And fell Charybdis murmured soft applause.”<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In the “Paradise Lost,” while portraying Sin, the terrible
portress at the gates of Hell, the poet repairs to
this story for illustration:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent4">“Far less abhorred than these,</div>
<div class="verse">Vexed Scylla, bathing in the sea that parts</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But, though frequently employing the story, Milton did
not use the proverb, and here transforms at least one
of the dangers.</p>

<p>Not only the story, but the proverb, was known to
Shakespeare, who makes Launcelot use it in his plain
talk with Jessica:&mdash;“Truly, then, I fear you are
damned both by father and mother: thus, when I
shun Scylla, your father, I fall into Charybdis, your
mother: well, you are gone both ways.”<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> Malone, in
his note, written in the last century, says: “Alluding
to the well-known line of a modern Latin poet, Philippe
Gualtier, in his poem entitled ‘Alexandreïs.’”
To this testimony of Malone’s, another editor, George
Steevens, whose early bibliographical tastes excited the
praise of Dibdin, adds: “Several translations of this adage
were obvious to Shakespeare. Among other places,
it is found in an ancient poem entitled ‘A Dialogue
between <i>Custom and Veritie</i>, concerning the use and
abuse of Dauncing and Minstrelsie’:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">But this proverb had already passed into tradition and
speech. That Shakespeare should seize and use it was
natural. He was the universal absorbent.</p>

<p>It did not require a Shakespeare to appropriate it.

<p class="noindent">Mr. Webster, in an argument before the Supreme Court
of the United States, quotes and applies the words of
Virgil describing these opposite perils, and warns against
Charybdis.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> The great orator of ancient Rome, in his
second Philippic, where Mark Antony is assailed with
all his splendid ability, after picturing the culprit as
seizing and squandering an enormous property, exclaims:
“What Charybdis was ever so voracious? Charybdis
do I say?&mdash;who, if she existed at all, was a single
animal.”<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> Antony is worse than Charybdis, but
there is no allusion to the sister peril. The proverb
had no existence at that time.</p>

<p>The history of this verse seemed for a while forgotten.
Like the Wandering Jew, it was a vagrant, unknown in
origin, but having perpetual life. Erasmus, with learning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
so vast, quotes it, with the variation <i>Incidit</i>, for
<i>Incidis</i>, in his great work on Proverbs, and owns that
he does not remember its author. Here is the confession:
“<i>Celebratur apud Latinos hic versiculus, quocunque
natus auctore, nam in præsentia non occurrit</i>”: “This
little verse is a commonplace among Latin writers, whoever
the author,&mdash;for he does not at present occur to
me.”<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> But, though unable to recall its origin, it is clear
that the idea it embodies found much favor with this
representative of moderation. He dwells on it with
particular sympathy, and reproduces it in various forms.
This is the equivalent on which he hangs his commentary:
“<i>Evitata Charybdi, in Scyllam incidi</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> It is easy
to see how inferior in form is this to the much quoted
verse. It seems to be a rendering of some Greek iambics,
also of uncertain origin, preserved by Apostolius,<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>
one of the learned Greeks scattered over Europe by
the fall of Constantinople. Erasmus quotes also another
proverb with the same signification: “<i>Fumum fugiens,
in ignem incidi</i>,”<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> which warns against running into the
fire to avoid the smoke; and yet another, rendered from
the Greek of Lucian: “<i>Ignoraveram autem quod, juxta
proverbium, ex fumo in ipsum ignem compellerer</i>”: “But
I didn’t know, that, according to the proverb, I should
be driven from the smoke into the fire itself.”<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> Horace

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span></p>
<p class="noindent">and then he describes one man as smelling of pastils,
and another of the goat:&mdash;</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Erasmus quotes words of kindred sentiment from the
“Phormio” of Terence: “<i>Ita fugias, ne præter casam</i>”:
which he tells us means that we should not so fly from
any vice as to be incautiously carried into a greater.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>
In his letters the ancient fable recurs more than once.
On one occasion he warns against the dangers of
youth, and says, “Instead of the ears with wax, as in
the Homeric story, the mind must be carefully sealed
by the precepts of Philosophy.”<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> Again he avows fear,
lest, shunning Scylla, he fall on a much worse Charybdis:
“<i>Nunc vereor ne sic vitemus hanc Scyllam, ut
incidamus in Charybdim multo perniciosiorem</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> And
the same fear appears yet again, where he describes
his straits: “<i>In has angustias protrusus sum, ut mihi,
si Scyllam fugero, in Charybdim sit incidendum</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>
On another occasion he pictures himself as exposed
in his expenses to the most voracious Charybdises:
“<i>Ex his conjecturam facias licebit, quemadmodum hic
dilabantur nummi, ubi nihil non meo sumptu geritur,
et est mihi res cum duabus Charybdibus voracissimis</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>
The following is cited by Jortin from another letter of
Erasmus:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span> “Some say slanderously that I keep a medium.
I confess it is a very impious thing to keep a
medium between Christ and Belial; but I think it prudential
to keep a medium between Scylla and Charybdis.”<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>
Thus did his instinctive prudence find expression
in this favorite illustration.</p>

<p>If Erasmus were less illustrious for learning, perhaps
if his countenance were less interesting, as we
look upon it in the immortal portraits by two great
artists, Hans Holbein and Albert Dürer, I should not be
tempted to dwell on this confession of ignorance. And
yet it belongs to the history of this verse, which has
had strange ups and downs. The poem from which it
is taken, after enjoying early renown, was forgotten,&mdash;and
then again, after a revival, was forgotten, again to
enjoy another revival. The last time it was revived
through this solitary verse, without which, I cannot
doubt, it would have expired forever.</p>

<p>Even before the days of Erasmus, who died in 1536,
this verse had been lost and found. It was circulated as
a proverb of unknown origin, when Galeotto Marzio&mdash;an
Italian of infinite wit and learning,<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> who flourished
in the latter half of the fifteenth century, and was for
some time instructor of the children of Matthias Corvinus,
King of Hungary&mdash;pointed out its author. In
a work of <i>Ana</i>, amusing and instructive, entitled “De
Doctrina Promiscua,” which first saw the light in Latin,
and was afterwards translated into Italian, the learned
author says: “<i>Hoc carmen est Gualteri Galli de Gestis
Alexandri, et non vagum proverbium, ut quidam non
omnino indocti meminerunt</i>.” It was not a vague proverb,
as some persons not altogether unlearned have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
supposed, but a verse of the “Alexandreïs.” And yet
shortly afterwards the great master of proverbs, whose
learning seemed to know no bounds, could not fix its
origin. At a later day, Pasquier, in his “Recherches
de la France,” made substantially the same remark as
Marzio. After alluding to the early fame of its author,
he says: “<i>C’est luy dans les œuvres duquel nous trouvons
un vers souvent par nous allegué, sans que plusieurs sçachient
qui en fut l’auteur</i>.” In quoting the verse, the
French author uses <i>Decidit</i> instead of <i>Incidis</i>.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> The
discovery by Marzio, and the repetition of this discovery
by Pasquier, are chronicled at a later day in the Conversations
of Ménage,<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> who found a French Boswell
before that of Dr. Johnson was born. Jortin, in the
elaborate notes to his Life of Erasmus, borrows from
Ménage, and gives the same history.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>When Galeotto Marzio made his discovery, the poem
was still in manuscript; but there were printed editions
before the “Adagia” of Erasmus. An eminent authority&mdash;the
“Histoire Littéraire de la France,” that great
work, commenced by the Benedictines, and continued by
the French Academy&mdash;says that it was printed for the
first time at Strasbourg, in 1513.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> This is a mistake
which has been repeated by Warton.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> Brunet, in his
“Manuel du Libraire,” mentions an edition, without
place or date, with the cipher of Guillaume Le Talleur,
a printer at Rouen in 1487.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> Panzer, in his “Annales
Typographici,” describes another edition, with the monogram<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
of Richard Pynson, the London printer at the
close of the fifteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> Beloe, in his “Anecdotes
of Literature,” also speaks of an edition with the
imprint of Pynson.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> There also appears to have been
an edition under date of 1496. Then came the Strasbourg
edition of 1513, by J. Adelphus. All these are
in black letter. Next was the Ingolstadt edition, in
1541, in Italic, or, as it is called by the French, “cursive
characters,” with a brief life of the poet, by Sebastian
Link. This was followed, in 1558, by an edition
at Lyons, also in Italic, announced as now for the first
time appearing in France, “<i>nunc primum in Gallia</i>,”
which was a mistake. This edition seems to have enjoyed
peculiar favor. It has been strangely confounded
with imaginary editions which never existed: thus,
the Italian Quadrio notes especially one at London, in
1558;<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> and the French Millin assures us that the best
was at Leyden, in 1558.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> No such editions appeared;
and the only edition of that year was at Lyons. After
the lapse of a century, in 1659, there was another edition,
by Athanasius Gugger, a monk of the Monastery
of St. Gall, published at the Monastery itself, from
manuscripts there, and with its own types, “<i>formis
ejusdem</i>.” The editor was ignorant of the previous editions,
and in his preface announces the poem as <i>a new
work</i>, although ancient,&mdash;never before printed, to his
knowledge,&mdash;eagerly regarded and desired by many,&mdash;and
not less venerable for antiquity than for erudition:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
“<i>En tibi, candide Lector, opus novum, ut sit antiquum,
nusquam, quod sciam, editum, a multis cupide inspectum
et desideratum, non minus antiquitate quam eruditione
venerabile</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> This edition seems to have been repeated
at St. Gall in 1693; and these two, which were the last,
appear to have been the best. From that time the poem
rested undisturbed until our own day, when it found a
place in that magnificent collection of patristic learning,
the “Patrologiæ Cursus Completus” of Migne.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> Such
an edition ought to be useful in determining the text,
for there must be numerous manuscripts in the Paris
libraries. As long ago as 1795 there were no less than
nineteen in the National Library, and also a manuscript
at Tours, which had drawn forth a curious commentary
by M. de Foncemagne.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p>I ought not to forget here that in 1537 a passage
from this poem was rendered into English blank verse,
and is an early monument of our language. This was
by Nicholas Grimoald, a native of Huntingdonshire,
whose translation is entitled “The Death of Zoroas, an
Egyptian Astronomer, in the First Fight that Alexander
had with the Persians.”<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> This is not the only
token of the attention it awakened in England. Alexander
Ross, chaplain of Charles the First, and author,
famous from a couplet of “Hudibras,” made preparations
for an edition. His dedicatory letter was written,
bearing date 1644, with two different sets of dedicatory
verses, and verses from his friend David Echlin, the
scholarly physician to the king,<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> who had given him
this “great treasure.” But the work failed to appear.
The identical copy presented by Echlin, with many
marginal notes from Quintus Curtius and others, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
mentioned as belonging to the Bishop of Ely at the beginning
of the present century.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> But the homage of
the Scotchman still exists in his Dedicatory Epistle:
“<i>Si materiam consideres, elegantissimam utilissimamque
historiam gestorum Alexandri magni continet; certe, sive
stylum, sive subjectum inspicias, dignam invenies quæ
omnium teratur manibus, quamque adolescentes</i></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p>It will be observed that he borrows superlatives to
praise this poem as “most elegant and most useful,”
and by style and subject worthy of the daily and
nightly study of youth. In his verses Ross declares
Alexander not less fortunate in his poet than the
Greek chieftain in Homer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p>There was also another edition planned in France,
during the latter part of the last century, by M. Daire,
the librarian of the Celestines in Paris, founded on the
Latin text, according to the various manuscripts, with a
French translation; but this never appeared.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>Until its late appearance in the collection of Migne,
it was only in ancient editions that this poem could
be found. Of course these are rare. The British Museum,
in its immense treasure-house, has the most
important, one of which belonged to the invaluable
legacy of the late Mr. Grenville. The copy in the
library of Lord Spencer is the Lyons edition of 1558.
By a singular fortune, this volume was missing some
time ago from its place on the shelves; but it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
since been found; and I have now before me a tracing
from its title-page. My own copy&mdash;and the only one
which I know this side of the Atlantic&mdash;is the Ingolstadt
edition. It once belonged to John Mitford, and
has on the fly-leaves notes in the autograph of this
honored lover of books.</p>

<p>Bibliography dwells with delight upon this poem,
although latterly the interest centres in a single line.
Brunet does full justice to it. So does his jealous rival,
Graesse, except where he blunders. Watt, in his “Bibliotheca
Britannica,” under the name “Galtherus, Philip,”
mentions the Lyons edition of 1558, on which he remarks,
“The typography is very singular”; and then,
under the name “Gualterus, de Castelliona,” he mentions
the edition of St. Gall in 1659. Curiously, the
learned bibliographer seems to suppose these two editions
to be different works, by different authors,&mdash;as
they stand far apart, and without reference from one to
the other. Clarke, in his “Repertorium Bibliographicum,”
bearing date 1819, where he gives an account of
the most celebrated British libraries, mentions a copy
of the first edition in the library of Mr. Steevens,<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> who
showed his knowledge of the poem in his notes to
Shakespeare; also a copy of the Lyons edition of 1558
in the library of the Marquis of Blandford, afterwards
Duke of Marlborough. This learned bibliographer has
a note calling attention to the fact that “there are variations
in the famous disputed line in different editions
of this poem,”&mdash;that in the first edition the line begins
“<i>Corruis in Syllam</i>” but in the Lyons edition “<i>Incidis
in Scyllam</i>” while, as we have already seen, Pasquier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
says, “<i>Decidit in Scyllam</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> Lowndes, in his “Bibliographer’s
Manual,” says of the poem, “In it will be
found that trite verse so often repeated, ‘<i>Incidis</i>,’” etc.,&mdash;words
which seem borrowed from Beloe.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> “Trite”
is hardly respectful.</p>

<p>Very little is known of the author. He is called in
Latin Philippus Gualterus or Galterus; in French it is
sometimes Gaultier and sometimes Gautier. The French
biographical dictionaries, whether of Michaud or Didot,
attest the number of persons with this name, of all degrees
and professions. There was the Norman knight
<i>sans Avoir</i>, a chief of the first Crusade. There also was
another Gautier, known as the Sire d’Yvetot, stabbed
to death by his sovereign, Clotaire, who is said afterwards
in penitence to have erected the lordship of
Yvetot into that kingdom which Béranger has immortalized.
And there have been others in every walk of
life. Fabricius, in his “Bibliotheca Latina Mediæ et
Infimæ Ætatis,”<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> mentions no less than seventy-two
Latin authors of this name. A single verse has saved
one of these from the oblivion that has overtaken the
multitude.</p>

<p>He was born at Lille, but at what precise date is uncertain.
Speaking generally, it may be said that he
lived and wrote during the second half of the twelfth
century, while Louis the Seventh and Philip Augustus
were kings of France, and Henry the Second and
Richard Cœur-de-Lion ruled England, one century after
Abélard, and one century before Dante. After studying
at Paris, he went to establish himself at Châtillon,&mdash;but
it is not known at which of the numerous towns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
of this name in France. Here he was charged with
the direction of the schools, and became known by the
name of the town, as appears in the epitaph, ambitiously
suggestive of Virgil, which he wrote for himself:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Insula me genuit, rapuit Castellio nomen;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Perstrepuit modulis Gallia tota meis.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But he is known sometimes by his birthplace, and sometimes
by his early residence. The highest French authority
calls him “Gaultier of Lille, or of Châtillon.”<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>
He has been sometimes confounded with Gaultier of
Coutances, Archbishop of Rouen, who was born in the
island of Jersey,<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>&mdash;and sometimes with the Bishop of
Maguelonne of the same name, reputed author of an
Exposition of the Psalter, whose see was on an island
in the Mediterranean, near the coast of France.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>Not content with residence at Châtillon, he repaired
to Bologna, in Italy, where he studied the Civil and
Canon Law. Returning to France, he became secretary
of two successive Archbishops of Rheims, the latter
of whom, by the name of William,&mdash;a descendant
by his grandmother from William the Conqueror,&mdash;occupied
this place of power from 1176 to 1201. The
secretary enjoyed the favor of the Archbishop, who
seems to have been fond of letters. It was during this
period that he composed, or at least finished, his poem.
Its date is sometimes placed at 1180; and there is an
allusion in its text which makes it near this time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
Thomas à Becket was assassinated before the altar of
Canterbury in 1170; and this event, so important in
the history of the age, is mentioned as recent: “<i>Nuper
… cæsum dolet Anglia Thomam.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> The poem was
dedicated to the Archbishop, who was to live immortal
in companionship with his secretary:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">The grateful Archbishop bestowed upon the poet a stall
in the cathedral of Amiens, where he died of the plague

<p>This does not appear to have been his only work.
Others are attributed to him. There are dialogues <i>adversus
Judæos</i>, which Oudin publishes in his collection
entitled “Veterum aliquot Galliæ et Belgii Scriptorum
Opuscula Sacra nunquam edita.” This same Oudin, in
another publication, speaks of “Opuscula Varia,” preserved
among the manuscripts in the Imperial Library<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>
of France, as by Gaultier, although the larger part of
these Opuscula have been ascribed to a very different
person, Gaultier Mapes, chaplain to Henry the Second,
King of England, and Archdeacon of Oxford.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> But
more recent researches would restore them to Philip
Gaultier. An edition appeared at Hanover, in Germany,
in 1859, by W. Müldener, after the Paris manuscripts,
with the following title:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span> “Die zehn Gedichte
des Walther von Lille genannt von Châtillon, zum ersten
Male vollständig herausgegeben.” Among these
are satirical songs in Latin on the World, and also on
Prelates, which, it is said, were sung in England as well
as throughout France.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> Indeed, the second verse of the

<p class="noindent">Here, as in the “Alexandreïs,” we encounter the indignant
sentiments inspired by the assassination of Becket.
The victim is called “the flower of priests,” and the
king “<i>Neronior est ipso Nerone</i>” which may be translated
by Shakespeare’s “out-Herods Herod.” But these
poems, whether by Walter Mapes or Philip Gaultier, are
forgotten. The “Alexandreïs” has a different fortune.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The poem became at once famous. It had the success
of Victor Hugo or Byron. Its author took rank,
not only at the head of his contemporaries, but even
among classics of antiquity. Leyser chronicles no less
than ninety-nine Latin poets in the twelfth century,<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>
but we are assured that not one of them is comparable
to Gaultier.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> M. Édélestand du Méril, who has given
especial attention to this period, speaks of the “Alexandreïs”
as a “great poem,” and remarks that its “Latinity
is very elegant for the time.”<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> Another authority calls
him “the first of the modern Latin poets who appears to
have had a spark of true poetic genius.”<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> And still
another says, that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span> “notwithstanding all its defects, we
must regard this poem, and the ‘Philippis’ of William
of Brittany, which appeared about sixty years later,
as two brilliant phenomena in the midst of the thick
darkness which covered Europe, from the decline of
the Roman Empire to the revival of letters in Italy.”<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>
Pasquier, to whom I have already referred, goes so far,
in his chapter on the University of Paris, as to illustrate
its founder, Peter Lombard, as having for a contemporary
“one Galterus, an eminent poet, who wrote
in Latin verses the life of Alexander, under the title
of the ‘Alexandreïs,’ a great imitator of Lucan”; and
the learned writer then adds, that it is in his work
that we find a verse often quoted without knowing the
author.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> These testimonies show his position among
contemporaries; but there is something more.</p>

<p>An anonymous Latin poet of the next century, who
has left a poem on the life and miracles of Saint Oswald,
calls Homer, Gaultier, and Lucan the three capital
heroic poets. Homer, he says, has celebrated Hercules,&mdash;Gaultier,
the son of Philip,&mdash;and Lucan, so he
declares, swells the praises of Cæsar; but these heroes
deserve to be immortalized in verse much less than
the holy confessor Oswald.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> In England, the Abbot
of Peterborough transcribed Seneca, Terence, Martial,
Claudian, and the “Gesta Alexandri.”<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> Even in Iceland
there was an early version, edited at a later day
by Arnas Magnæus (the Latin for Arne Magnussen),
Secretary and Antiquary to the King of Denmark,
and Professor in the University of Copenhagen, who,
styling the poem the “Gualterian Alexandreïs,” characterizes
the Icelandic version as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span> “the incomparable monument
of Northern antiquity.”<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> The new poem was
studied, even to the exclusion of ancient masters and
of Virgil himself. Henry of Ghent, who wrote about
1280, says that it “was of such dignity in the schools
of the grammarians that the reading of the ancient
poets was comparatively neglected.”<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> This testimony
is curiously confirmed by the condition of the manuscripts
that have come down to us, most of which are
loaded with glosses and interlinear explanations, doubtless
for public use in the schools.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> It is sometimes supposed
that Dante repaired to Paris. It is certain that
his excellent master, Brunetto Latini, passed much time
there. This must have been at the very period when
the new poem was taught in the schools. Perhaps it
may be traced in the “Divina Commedia.”</p>

<p>Next after the tale of Troy, the career of Alexander
was at this period the most popular subject for poetry,
romance, or chronicle. The Grecian conqueror filled a
vast space in the imagination. He was the centre of
marvel and of history. Every modern literature, according
to its development, testifies to this predominance.
Even dialects testify, and so does art. Wood
engraving is supposed to have been invented in Italy,
somewhere about 1285, by the two Cunio, and their
earliest work was a representation, in eight parts, of the
actions of Alexander, with explanatory verses in Latin
beneath the prints.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> In France, the professors of grammar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
at Toulouse were directed by statutes of the University,
dated 1328, to read to their pupils “De Historiis
Alexandri.”<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> In England, during the reign of Henry
the Third, the sheriff was ordered to procure the
Queen’s chamber at Nottingham to be painted with
the history of Alexander,&mdash;“<i>Depingi facias historiam,

of Fame,” places Alexander with Hercules,<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> and then
again shows the universality of his renown:&mdash;</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">We have the excellent authority of the poet Gray for
the remark, that the Alexandrine verse, which “like a
wounded snake drags its slow length along,” took its
name from an early poem in this measure, called “La
Vie d’Alexandre.” There was also the “Roman d’Alexandre,”
contemporary with the “Alexandreïs,” which
Gray thinks was borrowed from the latter, apparently
because the authors say that they took it from the
Latin.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> There was also “The Life and Actions of Alexander
the Macedonian,” originally written in Greek, by
Simeon Seth, magister, and protovestiary or wardrobe-keeper
of the palace at Constantinople, in 1070, and
translated from Greek into Latin, and thence into
French, Italian, and German.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> Other forms have been

Club and the Bannatyne Club. Arabia contributed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
her stories, and the Grecian conqueror became a
hero of romance. Like Charlemagne, he had his twelve
peers; and he also had a horn to proclaim his word of
command, which took sixty men to blow, and was
heard sixty miles,&mdash;being the same which Orlando
sounded afterwards at Roncesvalles. That great career,
which was one of the epochs of mankind, which carried
in its victorious march the Greek language and
Greek civilization, which at the time enlarged the geography
of the world, opening the way to India, and
which Plutarch in his “Morals” makes so Christian, was
overlaid by an incongruous mass of fable and anachronism,
so that the real story disappeared. Times, titles,
and places were confounded. Monks and convents,
churches and confessors, were mixed with achievements
of the hero; and in an early Spanish History of Alexander,
by Juan Lorenzo Segura, we meet such characters
as Don Phœbus, the Emperor Jupiter, and the
Count Don Demosthenes, and others with the constant
prefix of Don; and the mother of Achilles is represented
as placing him, when a child, in a convent of
Benedictine nuns,&mdash;thus subjecting the early hero as
the later to the same jumble of Heathen and Christian
mythology.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Philip Gaultier, with all his genius, has incongruities
and anachronisms; but his poem is founded substantially
upon the History of Quintus Curtius, which
he has done into Latin hexameters, with the addition
of long speeches and some few inventions. Aristotle
is represented with a hideous exterior, face and body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
lean, hair neglected, and the air of a pedant exhausted
by study. The soldiers of Alexander are called Quirites,
as if they were Romans. The month of June in
Greece is described as if it were in Rome:&mdash;</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Events connected with the passion of Jesus Christ are
treated as having already passed in the time of Alexander.</p>

<p>The poem is divided into ten books, corresponding
to the number in the original of Curtius,<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> and the ten
initial letters of the books, when put together like an
acrostic, spell the name of the Archbishop, <i>Guillermus</i>,
the equivalent for William at that time, the patron of
the poet. Besides this conceit, there is a dedication
both at the beginning and the end. Quantity, especially
in Greek or Asiatic words, is disregarded; and
there are affectations in style, of which the very beginning
is an instance:&mdash;</p>

<p>A rapid analysis will at least exhibit the order of
events in the poem, and its topics, with something of
its character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span></p>

<p>Alexander appears, in the first book, a youth panting
for combat with the Persians, enemies of his country
and of his father. There also is his teacher, Aristotle.
Philip dies, and the son repairs to Corinth for coronation.
Under the counsels of Demosthenes, the Athenians
declare against him. The young king arrives under
the walls of Athens. Demosthenes speaks for war;
Æschines for peace. The party of peace prevails; and
the Macedonian turns to Thebes, which he besieges
and captures by assault. The poet Cloades, approaching
the conqueror, chants in lyric verses an appeal for
pardon, and reminds him that without clemency a kingdom
is unstable:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“<i>Instabile est regnum quod non clementia firmat.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And the words of this chant are still resounding. But
Alexander, angry and inexorable, will not relent. He
levels the towers, which had first risen to the music of
Amphion, and delivers the city to the flames,&mdash;thus
adding a new act to that tragic history which made
Dante select Thebes as the synonym of misfortune.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>
Turning from these smoking ruins, he gathers men and
ships against Persia. Traversing the sea, he lands in
Asia; and here the poet describes geographically the
different states of that continent,&mdash;Assyria, Media, Persia,
Arabia, with its Sabæan frankincense and its single
phœnix,&mdash;ending with Palestine, where a God was born
of a Virgin, at whose death the world shook with fear.
Commencing his march through Cilicia and Phrygia,
the ambitious youth stops at Troy, and visits the tomb
of Achilles, where he makes a long speech.</p>

<p>The second book opens with the impression on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
mind of Darius, menaced by his Macedonian enemy.
He writes an insolent letter, which Alexander answers
by moving forward. At Sardes he cuts the Gordian
knot, and then advances rapidly. Darius quits the
Euphrates with his vast army, which is described.
Alexander bathes in the cold waters of the Cydnus,
is seized with illness, and shows his generous trust
in the physician that attended him,&mdash;drinking the
handed cup, although said to be poisoned. Restored
to health, he shows himself to his troops, who are
transported with joy. Meanwhile the Persians advance.
Darius harangues. Alexander also. The two
armies prepare for battle.</p>

<p>The third book is of battle and victory at Issus, described
with minuteness and warmth. Here dies Zoroas,
the Egyptian astronomer, than whom nobody was more
skilled in the stars, the origin of winter’s cold or summer’s
heat, or in the mystery of squaring the circle,&mdash;“<i>circulus
an possit quadrari</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> The Persians are overcome.
Darius seeks shelter in Babylon. His treasures
are the prey of the conqueror. Horses are laden with
spoils, and the sacks are so full that they cannot be
tied. Rich ornaments are torn from the women, who
are surrendered to the brutality of the soldiers. Only
the royal family is spared. Conducted to the presence
of Alexander, they are received with the regard due to
their sex and misfortune. The siege and destruction
of Tyre follow; then the expedition to Egypt and the
temple of Jupiter Ammon. Here is a description of
the Desert, which is said, like the sea, to have its
perils, with its Scylla and its Charybdis of sand:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Meanwhile Darius assembles new forces. Alexander
leaves Egypt and rushes to meet him. An eclipse of
the moon causes sedition among his soldiers, who dare
to accuse their king. The phenomenon is explained by
soothsayers, and the sedition is appeased.</p>

<p>The fourth book opens with a funeral. It is of the
Persian queen. Alexander laments her with tears. Darius
learns at the same time her death and the generosity
of his enemy. He addresses prayers to the gods
for the latter, and offers propositions of peace. Alexander
refuses these, and proceeds to bestow funeral honors
upon the spouse of him he was about to meet in battle.
Then comes an invention of the poet, which may have
suggested afterwards to Dante that most beautiful passage
of the “Purgatorio,” where great scenes are sculptured
on the walls.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> At the summit of a mountain a
tomb is constructed by the skilful Hebrew Apelles, to
receive the remains of the Persian queen; and on this
tomb are carved, not only kings and names of Greek
renown, but histories from the beginning of the world:&mdash;</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">At once, after these great obsequies, Alexander marches
against Darius. And here the poet dwells on the
scene of the Persian army watching by its camp-fires.
Helmets rival the stars; the firmament is surprised to
see fires like its own reflected from bucklers, and fears
lest the earth be changed into sky and the night become
day. Instead of the sun, there is the helmet of Darius,
which shines like Phœbus himself, and at its top a gem
of flame, obscuring the stars and yielding only to the
rays of the sun; for, as much as it yields to the latter,
so much does it prevail over the former. The youthful
chieftain, under protection of a benignant divinity,
passes the night in profound repose. His army is all
marshalled for the day, and he still sleeps. He is
waked, harangues his men, and gives the order for
battle. The victory of Arbela is at hand.</p>

<p>The fifth book is occupied with a description of this
battle. Here are episodes in imitation of the ancients,
with repetitions or parodies of Virgil. The poet apostrophizes
the unhappy, defeated Darius, as he is about
to flee, saying,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>“Whither do you go, O King, about
to perish in useless flight? You do not know, alas!
lost one, you do not know whom you flee. While you
flee from one enemy, you run upon other enemies. Desiring
to escape Charybdis, you fall upon Scylla.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The Persian monarch finds safety at last in Media, and
Alexander enters Babylon in triumph, surpassing all
other triumphs, even those of ancient Rome: and this
is merited,&mdash;so sings the poet,&mdash;for his exploits are
above those of the most celebrated warriors, whether
sung by Lucan in magnificent style, or by Claudian in
pompous verse. The poet closes the book by referring
to the condition of Christianity in his own age, exclaiming,
that, if God, touched by the groans and the longings
of his people, would accord to the French such a
king, the true faith would soon shine throughout the
universe. Had he witnessed either Bonaparte on the
throne of France, it is doubtful if he would not have
regretted his supplicatory prophecy, or rejected them
as unworthy of Alexander.</p>

<p>The sixth book glows with the luxury of Alexander at
Babylon, the capture of Susa, the pillage of Persepolis.
Here the poet forgets the recorded excesses of his hero,
with Thaïs by his side, and the final orgy, when the
celebrated city was handed to the flames at the bidding
of a courtesan; but he dwells on an incident of his
own invention, calculated to excite emotions of honor
rather than of condemnation. Alexander meets three
thousand Greek prisoners, wretchedly mutilated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
the Persians, and delivers them. He leaves to them
the choice of returning to Greece, or of fixing themselves
in the country there on lands he promises to
distribute. Some propose to go back. Others insist,
that, in their hideous condition, they cannot return to
the eyes of their families and friends, when an orator
declares that it is always pleasant to see again one’s
country, that there is nothing shameful in the condition
caused by a barbarous enemy, and that it is unjust to
those who love them to think that they will not be
glad to see them. A few follow the orator; but the
larger part remain behind, and receive from their liberator
the land he had promised, also money, flocks,
and whatever was necessary for farmers.</p>

<p>In the seventh book we meet the treason of Bessus
substantially as in Quintus Curtius. Darius, with
chains of gold on his feet, is carried in a closed vehicle
to be delivered up. Alexander, who was still in
pursuit of his enemy, is horror-struck. With more
rapidity he moves to deliver or to avenge the Persian
monarch than he ever moved to his defeat. He is
aroused against the criminals, like Jupiter pursuing
the Giants with his thunder. Darius is found in his
carriage covered with wounds and bathed in his blood.
With the little breath that remains, and yet struggling
on the last confines of life, he makes a long speech,
which the poet follows with bitter exclamations against
his own age, beginning with venal Simon and his followers,
and ending with the assassins of Thomas à
Becket:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">These ejaculations are closed by an address to the
manes of Darius, and a promise to immortalize him in
the verse of the poet. The grief of Alexander for the
Persian queen is renewed for the sovereign. The Hebrew
Apelles is charged to erect in his honor a lofty
pyramid in white marble, with sculptures in gold. Four
columns of silver, with base and capital of gold, support
with admirable art a concave vault, where are represented
the three continents of the terrestrial globe, with
their rivers, forests, mountains, cities, and people. In

<p class="noindent">From funeral the poet passes to festival, and portrays
the banquets and indulgence to which Alexander now
invites his army. Sedition ensues. The soldiers ask
return to their country. Alexander harangues and
awakens the love of glory. They swear to confront
all dangers, following him to the end of the world.</p>

<p>The eighth book chronicles the march into Hyrcania;
the visit of Talestris, queen of the Amazons, and her
Amazonian life, with one breast burnt so as to accommodate
the bent bow; then the voluntary sacrifice of
all the immense booty of the conqueror, as an example
for the troops; then the conspiracy against Alexander
in his own camp, with the examination and torture of
the son of Parmenio, suspected of complicity; and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
the doom of Bessus, the murderer of Darius, who is
delivered by Alexander to the brother of his victim.
Then comes the expedition to Scythia. The Macedonian,
on the banks of the Tanaïs, receives an embassy.
The ambassador fails to delay him; he crosses the river,
and reduces the deserts and mountains of Scythia. And
here the poet likens this people, which, after resisting
so many powerful nations, now falls under the yoke,
to a lofty, star-seeking Alpine fir, “<i>astra petens abies</i>,”<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a>
which, after resisting for ages all the winds of the East,
of the West, and of the South, falls under the blows
of Boreas. The name of the conqueror becomes a terror,
and other nations in this distant region submit voluntarily,
without a blow.</p>

<p class="noindent">Here comes the march upon India. Kings successively
submit. Porus alone dares to resist. With a numerous
army he awaits the Macedonian on the Hydaspes. The
two armies stand face to face on the opposite banks.
Then occurs the episode of two youthful Greeks, Nicanor
and Symmachus, born the same day, and attached
like Nisus and Euryalus. Their perilous expedition
fails, under pressure of numbers, and the two friends,
cut off and wounded, after prodigies of valor, at last
embrace, and die in each other’s arms. Then comes
the great battle. Porus, vanquished, wounded, and a
prisoner, is brought before Alexander. His noble spirit
touches the generous heart of the conqueror, who restores<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>

the number of friends:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">A single city arrests the triumphant march. Alexander
besieges it, and himself mounts the first to the assault.
His men are driven back. Then from the top of the
ladder, instead of leaping back, he throws himself into
the city, and alone encounters the foe. Surrounded, belabored,
wounded, he is about to perish, when his men,
learning his peril, redouble their efforts, burst open the
gates, inundate the place, and massacre the inhabitants.
After a painful operation, Alexander is restored to his
army and to his great plans of conquest. The joy
of the soldiers, succeeding sorrow, is likened to that
of sailors, who, after seeing the pilot overboard, and
ready to be ingulfed by the raging floods, as Boreas
plays the Bacchanal, “<i>Borea bacchante</i>,”<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> at last behold
him rescued from the abyss and again at the helm.
But the army is disturbed by preparation for distant
maritime expeditions. Alexander avows that the world
is too small for him; that, when it is all conquered,
he will push on to subjugate another universe; that
he will lead them to the Antipodes, and to another
Nature; and that, if they refuse to accompany him, he
will go forth alone, and offer himself as chief to other
people. The army is on fire with this answer, and vow
again never to abandon their king.</p>

returns to Babylon. The universe is in suspense, not
knowing to which side he will direct his arms. From
all quarters ambassadors come to his feet. In the pride
of power he is universal lord. At a feast, surrounded

showing to the last grandeur and courage. The poet

<p>Such is the sketch of a curiosity of literature. It
is interesting to look upon this little book, which for
a time played so considerable a part; to imagine the
youthful students once nurtured by it; to recognize its
relations to an age when darkness was slowly yielding
to light; to note its possible suggestions to great poets
who followed, especially to Dante; and to behold it
lost from human knowledge, and absolutely forgotten,
until saved by a single verse, which, from its completeness
of form and its proverbial character, must
live as long as the Latin language. The verse does
not occupy much room; but it is a sure fee-simple
for the poet. And are we not told by an ancient,
that it is something, in whatsoever place or corner,
to have made one’s self master of a spot big enough
for a single lizard?</p>

<p class="noindent">A poem of ten books shrinks to a very petty space.
There is a balm of a thousand flowers, and here a single
hexameter is the express essence of many times a
thousand verses. It was the jest of Hamlet, conversing
with Horatio in the churchyard, that the noble
Alexander, returning to dust and loam, had stopped
a bung-hole. But the memorable poem celebrating
him, while reduced as much, may be put to far higher
and more enduring use.</p>

<h3>MORAL.</h3>

<p>At the conclusion of a fable there is a moral, or, as
sometimes called, the application. There is a moral
now, or, if you please, the application. And, believe
me, in these serious days, I should have little heart
for literary diversion, if I did not hope to make it
help those just principles which are essential to the
well-being, if not the safety, of the Republic. To this
end I have written. This article is only a long whip
with a snapper.</p>

<p>Two verses rescued from the wreck of a once popular
poem have become proverbs, and one of these is
very famous. They inculcate clemency, and the common
sense found in not running upon one danger to
avoid another. Never was the lesson more needed than
now, when, in the name of clemency to belligerent traitors,
the National Government is preparing to abandon
the freedman, to whom it is bound by the most sacred
ties,&mdash;is preparing to abandon the national creditor
also, with whose security the national welfare is indissolubly
associated,&mdash;and is even preparing, without
probation or trial, to invest belligerent traitors, who for
four bloody years have murdered our fellow-citizens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
with those Equal Rights in the Republic which are
denied to friends and allies, so that the former shall
rule over the latter. Verily, here is a case for common
sense.</p>

<p>The lesson of clemency is of perpetual obligation.
Thanks to the mediæval poet for teaching it! Harshness
is bad. Cruelty is detestable. Even justice may
relent at the prompting of mercy. Fail not, then, to
cultivate the grace of clemency. Perhaps no scene in
history is more charming than that of Cæsar, who, after
vows against an enemy, listened calmly to the appeal
for pardon, and, listening, let the guilty papers fall
from his hand. Early in life he had pleaded in the
Senate for the lives of conspirators; and afterwards,
when supreme ruler of the Roman world, practised
the clemency he had once defended, except where enemies
were incorrigible, and then he knew how to be
rigorous and firm. By example we are instructed;
and from the great master of clemency we may well
learn that the general welfare must not be sacrificed
to this indulgence. And also from the Divine Teacher
we may learn, that, even while forgiving enemies, there
are Scribes and Pharisees to be exposed, and money-changers
who must be scourged from the temple. But
with us are Scribes and Pharisees, and there are also
criminals, worse than any money-changers, now trying
to establish themselves in the very temple of our Government.</p>

<p>Cultivate clemency. But consider well what is embraced
in this charity. It is not required that you
surrender the Republic into the hands of pardoned
criminals. It is not required that you surrender friends
and allies to the tender mercies of these same pardoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
criminals. Clearly not. Clemency has limitations; and
when it transcends these, it ceases to be a virtue, and
is only a mischievous indulgence. Of course, one of
these limitations, never to be disregarded, is <i>the general
security</i>, which is the first duty of Government.
No pardon can be allowed to imperil the nation; nor
can any pardon be allowed to imperil those rightfully
looking to us for protection. There must be no vengeance
upon enemies; but there must be no sacrifice
of friends. And here is the distinction never to be
forgotten. <i>Nothing for vengeance; everything for justice.</i>
Follow this rule, and the Republic will be safe and
glorious. Words attributed to Marcus Aurelius in a
letter to his colleague in empire, Lucius Verus, are
worthy to be repeated now by the chief of the Republic:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent10">“Ever since the Fates</div>
<div class="verse">Placed me upon the throne, two aims have I</div>
<div class="verse">Kept fixed before my eyes; and they are these,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Not to revenge me on my enemies,</div>
<div class="verse"><i>And not to be ungrateful to my friends</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It is easy for the individual to forgive. It is easy,
also, for the Republic to be generous. But forgiveness
of offences must not be a letter of license to crime;
it must not be recognition of an ancient tyranny, and
it must not be stupendous ingratitude. There is a familiar
saying, with the salt of ages, that is addressed
to us now: “Be just before you are generous.” Be
just to all before you are generous to the few. Be
just to the millions <i>only half rescued</i> from oppression,
before you are generous to their cruel taskmasters.
Do not imitate that precious character in the gallery
of old Tallemant des Réaux,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span> “who built churches without
paying his debts.” Our foremost duties now are
to pay our debts, and these are twofold,&mdash;first, to
the national freedman, and, secondly, to the national
creditor.</p>

<p>Apply these obvious principles practically. A child
can do it. No duty of clemency can justify injustice.
Therefore, in exercising the beautiful power of pardon
at this moment, several conditions must be observed.</p>

<p>1. As a general rule, belligerent traitors, who have
battled against the country, must not be permitted <i>at
once</i>, without probation or trial, to resume old places of
trust and power. Such a concession would be clearly
against every suggestion of common sense, and President
Johnson doubtless saw it so, when, addressing
his fellow-citizens of Tennessee, June 9, 1864, he said:
“I say that traitors should take a back seat in the
work of restoration. If there be but five thousand
men in Tennessee loyal to the Constitution, loyal to
freedom, loyal to justice, these true and faithful men
should control the work of reorganization and reformation
absolutely.”<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> Let belligerent traitors be received
slowly and cautiously back into the sovereignty of
citizenship. Better that they should wait than the
general security be imperilled, or our solemn obligations,
whether to the national freedman or the national
creditor, impaired.</p>

<p>2. Especially are we bound, by every obligation
of justice and by every sentiment of honor, to see
that belligerent traitors, who have battled against their
country, are not allowed to rule the constant loyalists,
whether white or black, embracing the recent freedmen,
our friends and allies.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span></p>
<p>3. Let pardons issue only on satisfactory assurance
that the applicant, who has been engaged for four years
in murdering our fellow-citizens, shall sustain the Equal
Rights, civil and political, of all men, according to the
principles of the Declaration of Independence; that he
shall pledge himself to the support of the national debt;
and, if he be among the large holders of land, that he
shall set apart homesteads for all his freedmen.</p>

<p>Following these simple rules, clemency will be a
Christian virtue, and not a perilous folly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The other proverb has its voice also, saying plainly,
Follow common sense, and do not, while escaping one
danger, rush upon another. You are now escaping from
the whirlpool of war, which threatened to absorb and
ingulf the Republic. Rush not upon the opposite terror,
where another shipwreck of a different kind awaits
you, while Sirens tempt with “song of death.” Take
warning: <i>Seeking to escape Charybdis, do not drive upon
Scylla</i>.</p>

<p>Alas! the Scylla on which the Republic now drives
is that old rock of <i>concession and compromise</i> which
from the beginning has been a constant peril. It
appeared in the Convention that framed the National
Constitution, and ever afterwards, from year to year,
showed itself in Congress, until at last the Oligarchy,
nursed by our indulgence, rebelled. And now that the
war is over, it is proposed to invest the same Rebel
Oligarchy with a new lease of immense power, involving
control over loyal citizens, whose fidelity to the
Republic has been beyond question. Here, too, are
Sirens, in the shape of belligerent traitors, suing softly
that the Republic may be lured to the old concession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
and compromise. <i>Alas, that, escaping Charybdis, we
drive upon Scylla!</i></p>

<p>The Oligarchy conducted all its operations in the
name of State Rights, and in this name it rebelled.
And when the Republic sought to suppress the Rebellion,
it was replied, that a State could not be coerced.
Now that the Rebellion is overthrown, and a just effort
is made to obtain that “security for the future” without
which the war will have been in vain, the same
cry of State Rights is raised, and we are told again
that a State cannot be coerced,&mdash;as if the same mighty
power which directed armies upon the Rebellion could
be impotent to exact all needful safeguards. To overcome
these pretensions, and stamp <i>E Pluribus Unum</i>
ineffaceably upon the Republic, we contended in war;
and now we surrender again to these tyrannical pretensions.
Escaping from war, we drive upon the opposite
peril,&mdash;<i>as from Charybdis to Scylla</i>.</p>

<p>Again, we are told gravely, that the national power
which decreed Emancipation cannot maintain it by assuring
universal enfranchisement, because an imperial
government must be discountenanced,&mdash;as if the whole
suggestion of “imperialism” or “centralism” were not
out of place until the national security is established,
and our debts, whether to the national freedman or the
national creditor, are placed where they cannot be repudiated.
A phantom is created, and, to avoid this
phantom, we drive towards concession and compromise,&mdash;<i>as
from Charybdis to Scylla</i>.</p>

<p>Again, we are reminded that military power must
yield to the civil power and to the rights of self-government.
Therefore the Rebel States must be left
to themselves, each with full control over all, whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
white or black, within its borders, and empowered to
keep alive a Black Code abhorrent to civilization and
dangerous to liberty. Here, again, we drive from one
peril upon another. Every exercise of military power
is to be regretted, and yet there are occasions when
it cannot be avoided. War itself is the transcendent
example of this power. But transition from war to
peace must be assured by all possible safeguards. Civil
power and self-government cannot be conceded to belligerent
enemies until after the establishment of “security
for the future.” Such security is an indispensable
safeguard, without which there will be new disaster.
Therefore, in escaping from military power, care must
be taken not to run upon the opposite danger,&mdash;<i>as
from Charybdis to Scylla</i>.</p>

<p>Again, it is said solemnly, that “we must trust each
other”; which, being interpreted, means that the Republic
must proceed at once to trust belligerent enemies
who have for long years murdered our fellow-citizens.
Of course, this is only another form of surrender.
In trusting them, we concede political power,
including license to oppress loyal persons, whether
white or black, and especially the freedmen. For four
years we have met them in battle; and now we run
to trust them, and commit into their keeping the happiness
and well-being of others. There is peril in
trusting such an enemy, more even than in meeting
him on the field. God forbid that we drive now upon
this rock,&mdash;<i>as from Charybdis to Scylla</i>!</p>

<p>The true way is easy. Follow common sense. Seeking
to avoid one peril, steer clear of another. Consider
how everything of worth or honor is bound up
with the national security and the national faith,&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
that, until these are fixed beyond change, agriculture,
commerce, and industry of all kinds must suffer. Capital
cannot stay where justice is denied. Emigration
must avoid a land blasted by the spirit of caste. Cotton
itself will refuse to grow until labor is assured its
just reward. By natural consequence, the same Barbarism
which has drenched the land in blood will continue
to prevail, with wrong, outrage, and the insurrections
of an oppressed race; the national name will be
dishonored, and the national power weakened. But the
way is plain to avoid these calamities. <i>Follow common
sense; and obtain guaranties commensurate with the danger.</i>
Do this without delay, so that security and reconciliation
may not be postponed. Every day’s delay is
a loss to the national wealth and an injury to the national
treasury. But if adequate guaranties cannot be
obtained at once, then at least <i>postpone all present surrender
to the Oligarchy</i>, trusting meanwhile to Providence
for protection, and to time for that awakened
sense of justice and humanity which must in the end
prevail. And, finally, <i>be careful not to drive, under any
pretence, from Charybdis to Scylla</i>.</p>
